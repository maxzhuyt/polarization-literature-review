are not modeled in Qiu and Jiang (2013)’s work. Moreover,
the polarity of the interactions between the authors, positive
or negative, is guided and determined using lexicon-based
methods. In our work, we don’t exploit any external or speciﬁc sentiment lexicon to determine the type of interactions
between the authors, which makes our approach purely unsupervised, independent of any external knowledge.
   Recently, Thonet et al. (2017) propose different extended
versions of Social Network-LDA (SN-LDA) (Sachan et
al. 2014) that model the viewpoint discovery in social
media: the Social Network Viewpoint Discovery Models
(SNVDMs). Similar to our work, SNVDMs jointly model
topic, viewpoint and discourse. One of their main objectives is to accurately determine the author’s viewpoint. Conversely, they assume that the “homophily” pehenomenon is
governing the authors’ interactions. SNVDMs are experimented on political Twitter data, and consider a network
of replies and retweets interactions. The SNVDM-GPU, the                         Figure 1: Plate Notation of AITV model

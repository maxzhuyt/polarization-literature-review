Cues sent by political elites are known to influence public attitudes and behavior. Polarization in elite
rhetoric may hinder effective responses to public health crises, when accurate information and rapid
behavioral change can save lives. We examine polarization in cues sent to the public by current members of
the U.S. House and Senate during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring polarization as the
ability to correctly classify the partisanship of tweets’ authors based solely on the text and the dates they


                                                                                                                                                                     were sent. We find that Democrats discussed the crisis more frequently—emphasizing threats to public
health and American workers, while Republicans placed greater emphasis on China and businesses.
Polarization in elite discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in mid-February – weeks after the first
confirmed case in the United States – and continued into March. These divergent cues correspond with a
partisan divide in the public’s early reaction to the crisis.

   shows the cumulative count of deaths (9), and COVID-19 related tweets by party over time. Notably,
   Congressional Democrats discussed COVID-19 significantly more during the crisis. Plot (b) displays the 15
   largest absolute differences in words most frequently used by Democrats and Republicans. Compared to
   Democrats, Republicans more frequently discuss China, business interests, and frame the pandemic as a war,
   while Democrats discuss public health and aid to workers.

      Fig. 2. Classification accuracy, partisan COVID-19 language by roll call voting, and recall above
      no-information rate. Plot (a) k-fold prediction out of sample by week. Classification accuracy
      increases over time. This suggests that Democratic and Republican members of Congress are
      becoming more polarized over time. Plot (b) displays the increases political ideology of members
      of Congress by the median predicted probability of their test set tweets being authored by a
      Republican. Plot (c) displays rates of recall (recovery of true cases) by party. The lower bound is
      the naive probability of correctly classifying a Republican or Democratic member as such based
      solely on prevalence in the test sets, the upper bound displays the observed rate of recall, and the
      shaded area represents the increase in recall above the no-information rate.

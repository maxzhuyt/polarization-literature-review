  ABSTRACT Much ink has been spilled to describe the emergence and likely inﬂuence of the Tea
Party on the American political landscape. Pundits and journalists declared that the emergence
of the Tea Party movement pushed the Republican Party to a more extreme ideological position, which is generally anti-Washington. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the ideological
positions taken by candidates in the 2008 and 2012 pre-Iowa caucus Republican presidentialprimary debates. To establish the positions, we used the debate transcripts and a text-analytic
technique that placed the candidates on a single dimension. Findings show that, overall, the
2012 candidates moved closer to an anti-Washington ideology—associated with the Tea Party
movement—and away from the more traditional social conservative Republican ideology,
which was more salient in the 2008 debates. Both Mitt Romney and Ron Paul, the two candidates who ran in both elections, shifted signiﬁcantly in the ideological direction associated with
the Tea Party.

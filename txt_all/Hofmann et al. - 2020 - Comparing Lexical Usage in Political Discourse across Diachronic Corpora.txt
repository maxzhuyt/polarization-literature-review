We introduce a corpus of transcripts from Alþingi, the Icelandic parliament. The corpus is syntactically parsed for phrase structure
according to the annotation scheme of the Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC). This addition to IcePaHC makes it more
diverse with respect to text types and we argue that having a syntactically parsed corpus facilitates research on different types of texts.
We furthermore argue that the speech corpus can be treated somewhat like spoken language even though the transcripts differ in various
ways from daily spoken language. We also compare this text type to other types and argue that this genre can shed light on their
properties. Finally, we show how this addition to IcePaHC has helped us identify and solve issues with our parsing scheme.

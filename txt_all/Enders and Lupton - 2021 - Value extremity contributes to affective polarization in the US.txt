                                                                                      constructing a core value orientations scale for all individuals across time, following recent work

This value orientations scale is a reliable (α = 0.71) additive index comprised of eight items capturing individuals’ relative preferences for egalitarianism and moral traditionalism. Although many treat egalitarianism and moral traditionalism separately, recent work

                                                                                          After creating the value orientations scale, we construct the value polarization variable by calculating the absolute difference between each respondent’s value orientations score and the mean
                                                                                      value orientations score for members of the opposite party. In other words, if a respondent identifies as a Democrat, then his or her degree of value polarization will be calculated as the absolute
                                                                                      value of his or her value orientations scale score minus the average Republican value orientations
                                                                                      scale score. The larger the numerical value of the value polarization variable, the greater the difference between one’s own value profile and the average value orientation of out-party members.

                                                                                      when value preferences are extreme. Our evidence that value differences underlie affective polarization builds upon existing work showing that ideology—closely interwoven with values—is capable of producing emotional biases toward political out-groups (e.g., Rogowski and Sutherland,
                                                                                      2016; Webster and Abramowitz, 2017). It also builds on recent experimental work showing
                                                                                      that a hypothetical candidate’s ideological positioning affects citizens’ feeling thermometer ratings of the candidate far more than does the candidate’s party label (Lelkes, 2019). Our results
                                                                                      provide further skepticism of claims that sorted social identities alone are the salient source of

Instead, core values—the “glue” connecting disparate attitudes within relevant policy domains—are capable of producing observed affective evaluations of the major stimuli in the American political system.
                                                                                          We also wish to acknowledge that our argument and analyses do not deny, much less disprove,

Indeed, these findings provide additional caution to claims that values are immutable.

Mapping Italian News


Executive Summary

Introduction
This study presents an analysis of the online media coverage in the run up
of 2018 Italian General election. We illustrate how immigration, corruption
and privileges of the elite – also related to a certain rhetoric on the inability
of the state to protect the rights of the needy – were in fact the most salient
topics throughout the months before and during the election. Both topics
were largely central in both Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s Five Stars Movement
agenda. Nevertheless, the leaders most frequently cited in online news articles
were Matteo Renzi (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi (Forza Italia). By deep diving
into the contents of main leaders media coverage and respective social media
engagement we document the centrality of stories unravelling around leaders’
legal issues, alleged collusion and scandals.

While the media clusters emerging from the network analysis clearly resembles
the tripartite structure of the contemporary Italian politics articulated in centreleft, centre-right and Five Stars Movement, the different weight and articulation
within each cluster clearly describe the strengths of M5S and centre-right
(largely dominated by the League) and the weakness of the centre-left.

While our analysis depicted a clear profile of the actors and topics that catalyzed
the highest social media interactions and thus attention, we also illustrate a
number of strategies employed by different communities to amplify the reach
of contents aligned with own worldview while reframing negative coverage
through comments. Overall, explicitly partisan and hyper-partisan sources
catalyzed a significant share of the social media interactions performed by the
online audience in the lead up of the election.

The analysis includes the evaluation and mapping of the Italian media landscape
from several perspectives and is based on large-scale data collection of online
news articles published on the web, shared and interacted on Facebook and
Twitter.

Overview of Methods


•    Data collection of 84,815 news articles on Italian politics published between
     September 1 2017 and March 4 2018 (sources: Global Database of Society
     (GDELT), Google News, Twitter) with respective volume of Facebook
     interactions (reactions, comments and shares) observed every two hour for
     a week after publication (source: Facebook Graph API);
•    The interactions on media sources by users on Twitter and Facebook provides
     a broader perspective of the role and influence of media sources among
     people engaged in politics through social media;
•    The differential media sharing patterns of supporters of different Italian
     parties on Twitter enable a detailed analysis of the role of partisanship in
     the formation and function of media structures;
•    Content analysis using automated tools supports the tracking of topics over
     time among media sources;
•    Qualitative media analysis of individual cases studies enhances our
     understanding of media function, structure and patterns of partisan
     attention.

Immigration and failures of the welfare system fostered by the shortage of
resources allegedly caused by the privileges and corruption of the elite were
two most widely covered and engaged substantive issue in the run up of March
election


Immigration (also played in the context of a lack of security), the corruption and
privileges of the elite, sometimes invoked as the main cause of the failures of
the state to protect the rights of the needy (low-income individuals and families,
unemployed, retired, elderly, affected by natural disasters), were in fact the
most salient topics throughout the months before and during the campaign.
The veement and sometime violent calls for a stronger and stricter immigration
policy often sparkled the reactions of the supporter on the opposite side of the
political spectrum resulting in harsh discussions originated by the allegation of
incitement to violence, discrimination, racism and thus fascism. As the case of
Luca Traini and its consequent events clearly pointed out, more than seventy
years after the fall of the fascist dictatorship, the rhetoric that unravels around
fascism and anti-fascism still plays an effective role in igniting divisive debates
in the Italian society.

Key Takeaways
Both the topic of immigration and lack of effective welfare caused by the
privileges of the elite are played out in a context of an increasingly hybridizes
media landscape


While this study is devoted to observe online media, it is important to underline
that traditional media still plays a prominent role in the information diet of the
Italian citizen and television is still the most popular source of news. The first
and the second most engaging news stories in our dataset both relates to the
popular Sanremo TV music festival (see Appendix 2: Top News). Furthermore,
excerpts from TV shows are often consumed online. The popularity of these
contents, testified by the volume of social media interactions originated around
websites such as “Informazione Vera” (True Information) that mainly publishes
political video excerpts from TV shows often accompanied by clickbait titles,
speaks by itself about the hybridization of the contemporary Italian mediascape
(see Appendix 3: Top 25 sources).

                                                                                            Key Takeaways
Within the centre-right coalition the online partisan audience close to Salvini’s
League outperformed those of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia


At the same time, three of the free-to-air and several digital TV channels are still
part of the powerful media empire Mediaset directly or indirectly controlled by
the leader of Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi. Under this perspective, it is striking
to observe the low number of online media sources adjudicated to Forza Italia
via the Multi Party Media Partisanship Attention Score (MP-MPAS). While the
MP-MPAS does not directly measure the political leaning of a news media
source but instead the attention it received by the online supporters of a political
party, it is worth to note that the most prominent online media sources of
Berlusconi’s empire (Il Giornale, TGcom24) have been mostly adjudicated to
Salvini’s League. Speaking about the overall media ecosystem, it’s interesting to
add that around one month after the election, Mediaset decided to fire the
hosts of three political shows aired by their free-to-air channels. While the
official motivation was the low ratings reported by these shows, many political
observers argued that the firings were instead politically motivated by the show
being biased toward Salvini’s League.

Key Takeaways
The overall social media attention toward news media sources adjudicated to
M5S was only slightly outperformed by the cross-partisan category that includes
traditional newspapers such as La Repubblica, La Stampa, Corriere.it.


Both our Twitter and Facebook data clearly point out that the online activism
of both League and Five Stars Movement’ supporters successfully shifted the
agenda toward certain news stories and the attention toward certain media
sources. League has in fact the highest number of media sources adjudicated
while the sources in the M5S’ category gathered the highest volume of overall
Facebook interactions. The overall social media attention toward sources
adjudicated to M5S was only slightly outperformed by the cross-partisan
category that includes brands such as La Repubblica, La Stampa, Corriere.it and
other major mainstream media players. Furthermore, the attention toward
sources in the M5S category is concentrated on the official news channels of
the Movement: ilblogdellestelle.it and beppegrillo.it.

Similarly, the media coverage around the four main leaders pinpoint a
disproportionate social media engagement around Luigi Di Maio, despite the
relatively low media attention he received. The volume of engagement around
the 7,000 news stories mentioning M5S’s leader almost matches the volume of
interactions collected by the over 11,000 stories mentioning Matteo Renzi.

Key Takeaways
Overall, explicitly partisan and hyper-partisan sources catalyzed a significant
share of the social media interactions performed by the online audience in the
lead up of the election

Officially, explicitly or blatantly partisan media sources appear, in fact, multiple
time in the lists of most popular news sources (see Appendix 3). Three sources
particularly problematic made to the list of top 25 URLs with one entry: llfatto.it,
italia24ore.com and inews24.it. llfatto.it

 the Movement, starting from news stories published by their official party
 channels, tend to receive an higher volume of shares over comments.

     Elezioni - 2018
Mapping Italian News


 Introduction
 On March 4, 2018, Italy went to the polls to elect 630 members of the Chamber
 of Deputies and 315 elective members of the Senate of the Republic. While
 confirming a longstanding decreasing trend, the turnout (73%) marked only a
 slight drop compared to the 2013 elections. Three main political parties and
 coalitions competed, without success, to reach the threshold of 40% of votes
 required by the the new electoral law in order the win the majority of seats in
 both chambers. With the 37% of votes, the centre-right alliance, formed by Silvio
 Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (FI), Matteo Salvini’s League (LEGA) and Giorgia Meloni’s
 Brothers of Italy (FdI), won a plurality of seats in both chambers. The Five Stars
 Movement (M5S) led by Luigi Di Maio become the party with the largest share
 of votes (32%). The centre left coalition lead by Matteo Renzi and formed by the
 Democratic Party (PD), Together (an alliance formed by the green and socialists
 parties named INSIEME), More Europe (+EUROPA) and Popular Civic List (CP),
 come third with 23% of votes.

 While the no majority result was largely expected, March elections resulted
 in a radically altered equilibrium of power between the main political actors
 and within the coalitions and a sharply

 longstanding sharp socio-economic divide between the south and north of the
 country, votes casted on March 4 clustered geographically with the south of
 the country largely dominated by the Five Stars Movement and the north by
 a Centre-right where the League, formerly Northern League, played a key role
 (see Figure 8).

In this report we explore the dynamics of the election by analyzing over 80,000
news stories related to Italian politics, published by approximately 4,000 news
sources between September 1, 2017 and 04 March, 2018. For each news story
we measured, every two hours and for a week after publication, the volume of
Facebook interactions - namely comments, reactions (likes and the additional
reactions added by Facebook on February 2016) and shares received. Additionally
we also measured how often each sources were shared on Twitter. We used
Facebook data to identify what was highly salient and Twitter data to depict
the relationships among different media, stories and Twitter users.

The report is structured in three parts. The first part analyzes the relationships
between the different media sources. The second builds upon the partisan
attention devoted to different media source to illustrate the relationships
between stories, media sources, main political parties and politicians. Finally,
the third section dives deep into content by highlighting the most salient topics
of the political campaign overall and in relation to different political leaders.

The electoral success of Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s Five Stars Movement,
both often labeled as populist parties, is clearly mirrored both by the social
media popularity of news sources aligned with their views and by the salience
of topics at the centre of their political discourses.

Matteo Salvini successfully transformed the image of a party focused on defending
the rights of the economically productive north against the “widespread”
corruption of Rome government and the south, to that of an extreme right-wing
party defending the rights of the Italians against “the invasion” of immigrants
and thus potentially appealing to voters across the entire country. Luigi Di Maio
and the other M5S’ leaders also attempted to present the Five Stars Movements
under a new light. Anti-establishment stances such as the critics to Nato, Euro
and the European Union (until Brexit the M5S formed a group with the UKIP
in the European Parliament) were all smoothed in the attempt to avoid being
labeled as extremists. In a post-ideological political program where tax cuts
and public debt reduction happily coexist, the proposal for a universal basic
income - supposedly funded by cuts to politicians’ privileges and savings from
the fights against corruption, strongly characterized M5S campaign.

Immigration, the corruption and privileges of the elite often invoked as the
main cause of the failures of the state to protect the rights of the needy (lowincome individuals and families, unemployed, retired, elderly, affected by natural
disasters), were in fact the most salient topics throughout the months before
and during the campaign. The veement and sometime violent calls for a stronger
and stricter immigration policy often sparkled the reactions of the supporter
on the opposite side of the political spectrum resulting in harsh discussions
originated by the allegation of incitement to violence, discrimination, racism
and thus fascism. As the case of Luca        ... more than seventy years after

debates in the Italian society.

Both the main topics are played out in a context of an increasingly hybridizes
media landscape. While this study is devoted to observe online media, it is
important to underline that traditional media still plays a prominent role in the
information diet of the Italian citizen. Television is still the most popular source
of news. The first and the second most engaging news story in our dataset
both relates to the popular Sanremo TV music festival (see Appendix 2: Top
News). Furthermore, excerpts from TV shows are often consumed online. The
popularity of these contents, testified by the volume of social media interactions
originated around websites such as “Informazione Vera” (True Information) that
mainly publishes political video excerpts from TV shows often accompanied
by clickbait titles, speaks by itself about the hybridization of the contemporary
Italian mediascape (see Appendix 3: Top 25 sources).

At the same time, three of the free-to-air and several digital TV channels are still
part of the powerful media empire Mediaset directly or indirectly controlled by
the leader of Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi. Under this perspective, it is striking
to observe the low number of online media sources adjudicated to Forza Italia
via the Multi Party Media Partisanship Attention Score (MP-MPAS). While the
MP-MPAS does not directly measure the political leaning of a news media
source but instead the attention it received by supporters of a political party, it
is worth to note that the most prominent online media sources of Berlusconi’s
empire (Il Giornale, TGcom24) have been mostly adjudicated to Salvini’s League.
Speaking about the overall media ecosystem, it’s interesting to add that around
one month after the election, Mediaset decided to fire the hosts of three
political shows aired by their free-to-air channels. While the official motivation
was the low ratings reported by these shows, many political observers argued
that the firings were instead politically motivated by the show being biased
toward Salvini’s League1.

Both our Twitter and Facebook data clearly point out that the online activism
of both League and Five Stars Movement’ supporters successfully shifted the
agenda toward certain news stories and the attention toward certain media
sources. Lega has in fact the highest number of media source adjudicated
while the sources in the M5S’ category gathered the highest volume of overall
Facebook interactions. The overall social media attention toward sources
adjudicated to M5S was only slightly outperformed by the cross-partisan
category that includes brands such as La Repubblica, La Stampa, Corriere.it
and other major mainstream media players. Furthermore, the attention toward
sources in the M5S category is concentrated on the official news channels of
the Movement: ilblogdellestelle.it and beppegrillo.it.

with the Partito Democratico logo have supposedly been discovered in Sicily
was widely shared on Facebook during the election day and it is the 6th most
engaged URL in our entire dataset. Italia24ore.com perfectly represents the
category of for profit “fake news” and its most popular article, claiming that a
senator was beaten by two unemployed, made to 17th position of the most
engaging URLs. Finally, inews24.it, as surfaced by an investigation published
on November 21, 2017 by BuzzFeed2, is part of a fringe network of websites
and Facebook pages well known for spreading anti-immigrant news and
misinformation. Following BuzzFeed’ revelations, two Inews24 Facebook pages
(nearly 1.5 million followers at the time) have been removed by the platform’
administrators. Nevertheless, an inews24 rip-off of an article published by the
local newspaper Cronache Maceratesi few hours before discussing the inability
of the State to provide an accommodation for an old women affected by the
earthquake, also made to the list of most popular news stories.

While less productive than mainstream media in terms of the number of news
articles published (URLs), these partisan sources tend to gather, on an average
article, a comparable and sometimes higher number of Facebook interactions
than professional journalistic organizations. The combination of these two factors
made it difficult to properly estimate the reach (not to speak about the impact)
of the entire category of website producing problematic information3 compared
to contents produced by mainstream media4. By looking at the overall volume
of Facebook interactions, mainstream media clearly dominates also thanks
to the significantly higher volume of articles published. By looking instead at
the average volume of interactions per article, “alternative media” dominates
often due to the wide popularity of one or two articles over a relatively small
set of news stories published. At the same time, even the apparently simple
activity of categorizing news sources according to the distinction mainstream/
alternative online media is extremely challenging and almost impossible to be
carried out if not as a result of an in depth analysis of each article, website and
respective social media presence. Furthermore, beside the cases that made to
the top sources and URLs, it is reasonable to expect that the bulk of problematic
contents are concentrated in the long tail of news story getting moderate to
low attention. As pointed out by the so called long tail theory, the cumulated
attention of a large number of these stories can outperform the attention of a

always at risk of being both overestimated and underestimated.

Finally, thanks to the way the study was conceived, this report shed some light
on one of the gordian nodes of most recent online news studies. While our
analysis depicted a clear profile of the actors and topics that catalyzed the
highest social media interactions and thus attention, we are well aware that
these numbers may be artificially inflated by a wide range of legitimate and
fringe “attention hacking” interventions (advertising campaigns, coordinated
actions of large communities, bots and fake accounts)5. From organized and/
or automatic efforts to push an hashtag to trend on Twitter, to those aimed at
maximizing the visibility of certain contents or comments under popular social
media posts, recent electoral campaigns all around the world teaches us that
this techniques are effective and increasingly common. This practices must
be understood as a part of a strategy

                                            hacking” interventions ...
trending Twitter hashtags or Google
keywords, popular social media contents, ...) to formulate a quick guess on the
sentiment of the public opinion on certain topics. Attention data – after all –
are easily available, faster and cheaper than opinion polls. The various actors
aiming at manipulate the media are well aware of that and thus constantly
at work to serve the media salacious newsworthy not-necessarily-real stories
(think about the PizzaGate) backing certain worldviews6 in the hope to trick
the media in amplyinfing its reach. In their recent study, Julia Ebner and Jacob
Davey documented that, in the run up of the 2018 election, “several Italian
extreme-right groups were organising” – also in connection with international
boards such as 4chan and 8chan – “on the Telegram chat application, sharing
materials, memes and coordinating their strategic communication efforts to
influence the election outcome in favour of League and the Brothers of Italy”7. In
their upcoming report of the March election, the EU DisinfoLab, also scrutinized
at least two attempts to employ similar techniques to push fabricated contents
on Twitter8. Altrought lacking the sophistication and thus the efficacy of
other attempts staged in the run-up to other elections, the traces of media
manipulation activities reported by these studies should raise concerns toward
the impulse to simply translate the high volume of interactions we observed

around certain topics, media sources and political actors to the sentiment of
the Italian public opinion.

Under this perspective, the granularity of data we collected through our study
allow us to back the idea that certain strategies were employed to amplify
the reach of contents aligned with own worldview while criticizing negative
coverage. Of the three signals we observed, shares and reactions served the
first goal and comments the second. Of those types of interactions, reactions
are the most common followed by comments and shares. The three signals are
highly correlated, with comments being the less correlated with the others.
Given these regularities, we focused our attention on news stories showing an
odd ratio between shares and comments. As clearly pointed out by the second
chapter of this report, news stories with a negative coverage of the Five Stars
Movement or positive coverage of Renzi and Berlusconi tend to share a common
pattern characterized by a significantly higher proportion of comments over
shares. On the contrary, positive coverage of the Movement, starting from news
stories published by their official party channels, tend to receive an higher
volume of shares over comments. The strategy thus consists in attempting to
reframe a negative news story not aligned with the party views by means of
massive interventions in the comments of the social media post. The goal is to
exploit Facebook algorithm that pushes most interacted content to the top, in
order to show opinions contradicting those expressed in the news story first.


Methods
In this study we analyze online media coverage of the 2018 Italian general
election over the 6 months from September 2017 until the election in March
2018. This study builds upon, adapts and extends a methodology and approach
developed in prior efforts to study online media during political campaigns9.
Drawing on a variety of analytical approaches and data sources, we track the
role of media sources and actors that participate in the public debate; estimate
the network structure of the media sphere with particular attention to the
formation of political communities; and measure the evolution and prominence
of different topics, agendas, and frames over time.

We primarily rely upon data collected from three different sources: Global
Database of Society (GDELT), Google News and Twitter. Using this three
sources we collected over 80,000 news stories from a broad range of media
sites, campaign sites, government sites, private firms and blogs. For each news
story, we collected every two hour and for a week after publication the volume

the nearly 1.3 million URLs that were shared by these tweets to estimate the
network structure of the different media sources and measure the attention
devoted to different sources by partisan Twitter users. More specifically, to study
the interaction of partisanship and media, we adapted the candidate-focused
partisanship attention score derived from the sharing patterns of Twitter users
who retweeted Trump and Clinton10, to the Italian political context. We thus
developed by adaptation a party-focused partisanship attention score derived
from the sharing patterns of Twitter users who retweeted the official Twitter
account of a set of Italian politicians and political parties. These scores allow us
to identify and describe patterns of attention to different media sources from
supporters of the different parties.

Mapping Italian News


 Structure and Content
 The Twitter network of the media sources shared during the election campaign
 and pre-campaign allows several insights into the structure of Italian online
 media system and its political partisanship. The figures presented in this section
 represent the result of a projected bi-partite network that connected Twitter
 users to media sources they had shared on Twitter. Through the process of
 projection, two sources that were shared by the same users were connected and
 the user removed. In the resulting networks then, media sources are connected
 when they have been shared by the same Twitter user. In the context of figures 9
 to 12, the structure of the network (the connections among the nodes) is defined
 by the users sharing activity while the political leaning of the media sources (the
 color of the nodes) is defined according to the process of adjudication of media
 sources to political parties described in the methods section. Moreover, each
 figure shows the size of the nodes according to a different Facebook metric:
 Total Facebook of interactions (Figure 9), Facebook Comments (Figure 10),
 Facebook Shares (Figure 11) and Reactions (Figure 12). This aggregate metrics
 results from the sum of interactions gathered by each news stories published
 by a certain media source over the entire period of observation.


 The Twitter network of media sources shows a relative clustered structure
 with the nodes polarized around three major areas corresponding to three
 different parties: Five Stars Movement (yellow), Democratic Party (pink),
 League (Blue). Beside these three main political actors, there is a group of
 sources that are coloured in gray and that are unassigned to a specific political
 party since they have been shared by a politically heterogeneous audience.

In the following we will refer to these sources as “Cross-partisan” sources.
Figure 9 shows the size of nodes proportional to the total number of the Facebook
interaction of the sources. This visualization gives a good overview of the main
actors and it is interesting to observe how the number of large nodes (those
able to attract a higher number of Facebook interactions) is different between
different types of political polarization. The area connected with the Five Stars
Movement (M5S) has at least 4 major actors: Il Fatto Quotidiano – newspaper
that has always been perceived “friendly” toward the M5S – , beppegrillo.it and
ilblogdellestelle.it – two official websites of the M5S, and fanpage.it – a website
that, during the election campaign, released an extensive reportage about
illegal dumping of waste in the region of Campania allegedly involving several
notable politicians of the Democratic Party.
The area of the network associated with the Democratic Party (and partially
with the left-leaning “Free and Equals”) is not characterized by any major media
source but it rather show a cohese network of minor sources. The blue part of
the network, dominated by sources shared by users leaning toward the political
position of the League, sees a central role of the newspaper Il Giornale and of
TgCom24, news service of Mediaset. Beside these two actors, a notable role
is played by the website Ilpopulista.it (The populist) a recently started newsoriented website who’s co-director is Matteo Salvini himself, the leader of the
League.

relative position within the network to
understand more in details the actual ideological position of the sources. In this
respect, it is worth keeping in mind that while the political leaning of the media
sources is defined through the political leaning of the users who shared news
from that sources, the position of the news sources within the network is defined
by a force-based layout algorithm11 that groups together nodes that are highly
interconnected. This means that, bearing in mind the threshold introduced in
the process of adjudication of political leaning (see Appendix 1: Methods), the
network visualization allows a more fine grained picture of the Italian media
sphere. By looking at the position of the node within the network, it is in fact
possible to distinguish within the group of cross-partisan media sources (colored
in grey) those more frequently associated with other sources with a clear
political leaning. This seems to be the case with La Repubblica, a newspaper
that traditionally has been associated with center-left political positions and
that happened to be shared by a politically cross-partisan audience while, at

 center-left sources. In a similar way, Il Corriere della Sera and La Stampa, are
 shared by cross-partisan audiences but the first is more frequently co-shared

and shares received by the source on Facebook. It is interesting to observe
how the main actors are stable as well as the relative differences among them.
Nevertheless there is a significant difference that can be better observed in

are the official and pseudo-official online presence of the M5S. It is interesting
to observe how in these cases reactions and shares contributes much more
than comments to the overall volume of Facebook interactions. A preliminary
interpretation of this suggests that traditional newspapers, as well as news
organizations such as ANSA or the Huffington Post Italia, receive large part
of their Facebook interactions from debates and comments between readers
while blogs such as beppegrillo.it or ilblogdellestelle.it seem to host a minor
level of debate.


One last element worth discussing from the analysis of the network is the
modular structure of the networked media system. It is worth remembering that
in Figures 9 to 12 the colours of the nodes is not the result of the connections
existing within the nodes, but of the political leaning of the source defined
using the political leaning of the users who shared the source. For this reason,

those visualizations leave unanswered the question if also the structure of the
network – the connection of co-sharing existing between two media sources –
represents the tripolar political system that emerged from the election.
Figure 14 addresses this question and shows the network visualizing the
results of a community detection method based on modularity optimization12.
Modularity optimization approaches to community detection identify a specific
community structure such that the proposed clusters of nodes (modules) will
contain nodes with dense connections between the nodes within the same
module but sparse connections with nodes in different modules. It is interesting
to observe how this approach results into exactly three communities that are
largely overlapping with the groups labelled according to the political leaning.
Within this perspective the validity of the sources political leaning is confirmed
by the analysis of the network structure.


Following the insights suggested by the broad pictures of the networked media
system, next chapter presents a detailed analysis based on the political leaning
of the news media sources. In light of this analysis, it also provides a further
explanation of the peculiar ratio between comments and shares pinpointed in
this chapter.

 A Structural View of Partisan Media

 Partisan Attention to Media Sources
 As anticipated in the methods section and described in full details in Appendix
 1, the Multi Party Media Partisanship Attention Score (MP-MPAS) is an alignment
 score that measures the partisan leaning of a media source. In this chapter, we
 focus on the niches that political actors occupied with reference to specific
 media outlets, assessing their relevance through the different Facebook metrics
 (reactions, comments, shares) that compose our dataset.

 We start by showing (Figure 15) how each of the ten most engaging media
 sources identified during the election campaign scored in term of media
 partisanship attention. It should be noted that our score is not comprehensive
 of all the Italian political actors, since it focuses exclusively on political parties
 having an independent group in Parliament and at least one partisan media
 source assigned. Media sources have been associated to the political party
 having obtained the higher partisan attention score on that specific source.
 However, we have subsequently classified as “Cross-partisan” all the sources for
 which none of the parties we have considered has a score higher or equal to
 0.33 (which thus represents our attribution threshold).

 Figure 15 clearly shows that, throughout the months leading to the election,
 Five Stars Movement’s supporters have been highly active in sharing news stories
 from partisan (ilblogdellestelle.it, beppegrillo.it) as well as mainstream (such
 as fanpage.it) media sources, strongly polarizing the sharing activities around
 these sources. Also supporters of the League have been very active in sharing
 news stories during the campaign: while they have been able to “dominate”
 the sharing activity (by reaching the attribution threshold) around only one
 of the ten most engaging sources (i.e. ilgiornale.it), League scores either first
 or second in all of the ten sources considered. The sharing activity of League’s
 supporters have been thus more evenly distributed among different sources
 compared with the one of Five Stars Movement’s people, whose activity was
 more concentrated around a handful of sources.

 Conversely the political party that seems to be most disadvantaged by the
 election campaign news media system was Forza Italia, which was not able
 to even reach the 0.1 threshold in any of the ten sources considered in Figure
 15. However, we have to mention that Forza Italia leader, Silvio Berlusconi, has
 opened his Twitter account just in October 2017, thus being disadvantaged in
 terms of social media exposure and news coverage. Considering that this index
 is based on how frequently media sources were shared by users who retweeted
 posts from Italian political parties or candidates, the communication strategies
 and news coverage on Twitter turned out to be relevant in the Multi Party Media

Partisanship Attention Score index building.
Free and Equal effort is similar, but slightly better than Forza Italia one. In this
case, the party exposure on Twitter could be influenced by the handicap of being
a new political subject, even though it has been founded by long experience
politicians.
The Democratic Party effort also was not brilliant, in particular considering that
it was not able to even reach the threshold score of Repubblica, traditionally
the news media outlet nearest to the center-left wing.


Figure 16 considers the subset of sources13 we have included in our Multi Party
Media Partisanship Attention Score study (N=628), attributing them to the eight
political parties considered when the attribution threshold has been reached,
while assigning a source to the “Cross-partisan” group when this is not the case.
This broad picture confirms what has already emerged from the analysis of the
top 10 sources: the League ranks first in term of sources attributed (i.e. whose
articles have been dominantly shared by League supporters), followed by crosspartisan media and by the Five Stars Movement sources. Conversely, the left
and center-left parties (Democratic Party, Free and Equal, Power to the People,
Insieme and +Europa) have been attributed a much more limited number of
sources. Finally Forza Italia, in spite of its long-standing presence and relevance
within the Italian party system and its decent performance in the 2018 election
(14% of the votes) has been assigned a residual number of sources (4), the same

number obtained by Power to the People, a newborn and electorally marginal
political actor.


Let’s now focus on levels of engagement (as the sum of reactions, shares and
comments) obtained on Facebook by the sources attributed to each political
actor. As can be observed in Figure 17, sources attributed to the Five Stars
Movement and those that we classified as Cross-partisan have been able to
generate a similar level of engagement outperforming all other sources.
Conversely, media sources having attracted a dominant attention from
supporters of the League, in spite of being a larger number (Figure 17) had a
more limited Facebook engagement performance, at least in aggregate terms.
Finally, sources associated to the Democratic Party and Free and Equal generated
a residual number of interactions compared with top three and media sources
assigned to Forza Italia collected less Facebook total interactions than Power to
the People, a very young far-left political subject.


Taken together all these findings suggests that media sources having captured
the attention of supporters of the League party have produced a great amount
of news stories during the election campaign, but such productivity did not
generate the same level of engagement generated by the less productive
sources patrolled by Five Stars Movements activists.

The role of Facebook Metrics in Media Sources Partisan Attention
Let’s now focus specifically on different means of Facebook engagement by
unpacking the data presented in Figure 17. For each clusters of sources we
in first place selected the top ten based on total interactions. Tables 1 to 3
show how these top sources performed in term of single metrics (reactions,
comments and shares). A bird eye observation of these data shows that the
distribution of different metrics is highly uneven with reactions representing in
general the preferred mean of interaction, followed by comments, while sharing
activity is more limited. Interestingly, however, this pattern is disconfirmed for
some of the sources attributed to the Five Stars Movement.

Looking at sources that have been attributed to the League (Table 1) it can be
observed that top sites are predominantly mainstream news media or large
media organizations, owned or related to Berlusconi’s family business, such as
tgcom24.mediaset.it, a Mediaset all-news channel. In this cluster however, we
can also notice two hyper-partisan14 media sources, such as ilpopulista.it and
piovegovernoladro.info. The interactions distribution follows the general trend
described above, in which reactions is the most common mean of engagement,
and appears homogeneously distributed, without any relevant outlier.

Table 1: Media sources from the League party with most Facebook reactions, comments and shares

A look to the Five Stars Movement cluster (Table 2) reveals how, especially the
top sources, have been characterized by a massive amount of interactions. The
media sources attributed to the Five Stars Movement are pretty heterogeneous,
with a prevalence of hyperpartisan sites (5stellenews.com, silenziefalsita.it, and
informazionevera.it). The cluster, however, is dominated by ilfattoquotidiano.
it, a mainstream newspaper whose positions are close to the M5S, and other
mainstream outlets are included in the list, namely fanpage.it, which is an online
news organization, ilmattino.it and video.corriere.it, which are the websites of
two news media organizations, and espresso.repubblica.it, a magazine which is
part of the same publishing group of La Repubblica newspaper.

Within the M5S cluster there are three cases in which the shares’ count is higher
than the comments’ one. The first two cases are ilblogdellestelle.it – the official
party’s website –, and beppegrillo.it – which is Beppe Grillo official blog. The third
one, instead, is 5stellenews.com, an unofficial news media site integrated into
the Five Stars Movement blogs universe. Ilblogdellestelle.it and beppegrillo.it
are the only two media sources in which the shares count is significantly higher
than the comments count, about the double for ilblogdellestelle.it. This finding,
which stand against the general patterns described above, seems confirming
that spreading the official and unofficial voices of the M5S represent a goal
that supporters of this party take more seriously than those of other political
formations.

The clusters grouping sources who have not being attributed to any single
political actor is mainly characterized (Table 3) by national mainstream news
media sources and general press agencies websites (repubblica.it, lastampa.it,
corriere.it, ansa.it, ilmessaggero.it), by some of the local editions of the national
newspaper Repubblica and by video.repubblica.it, the Repubblica’ section
dedicated to videos. The Italian version of the Huffington Post, huffingtonpost.
it, is also included in the list.
The so called Cross-partisan cluster also features lercio.it, which is a satire news
site, deliberately spreading ironic hoaxes; probably for this reason it is the only
media source in this group where the number of shares is noticeably higher
than the number of comments.

Table 3: Media sources from the cross-partisan segment with most Facebook reactions, comments and
shares

The Democratic Party cluster (Table 4) is characterized by a much more limited
amount of Facebook interactions compared with the other clusters described so
far, and it also features some peculiarities in term of media sources distribution.
Concerning the engagement performance of the sources that have been
attributed to the Democratic Party, the table confirms that Facebook interactions
level is very low compared with the other clusters. Nextquotidiano.it, a hyperpartisan source close to the Democratic Party, is the first media source of this
list and it has collected 293,956 reactions, 191,519 comments and 70,887 shares
during the observation period. The NextQuotidiano number of interactions is
very low compared with ilgiornale.it, ilfattoquotidiano.it and repubblica.it, the
first media sources in the other lists. This could be partially explained by the
fact that the latters are all mainstream media organizations; however, even if
we compare nextquotidiano.it with ilpopulista.it (760,276 reactions, 299,766
comments and 100,738 shares) or beppegrillo.it (1,223,890 reactions, 163,816
comments 293,264 shares), the number of Facebook interactions is still very
limited. The amount of Facebook interactions is even lower in the case of
democratica.com, the official party’s press website.
Moreover, as we described above, the Democratic Party cluster does not include
any relevant national media outlet, such as ilfattoquotidiano.it (Five Stars
Movement cluster) and ilgiornale.it (the League cluster), that may contribute in
increasing the number of interaction characterizing the cluster of sources that
have been associated to the Democratic Party.
In this table, we can also notice the presence of the website iene.mediaset.it,
an infotainment TV show broadcasted by the Mediaset Channel’s, Italia 1. This
TV show usually airs journalistic investigations featuring stories highly critical
of the political establishment, which are highly coherent with the Five Stars
Movement narrative. However, by airing of an investigation related to the highly
debated reimbursement system employed by Five Stars Movement MPs, this
media source attracted the attention of supporters of Democratic Party, as we
will describe more in details in the next sections of the present chapter.

Table 4: Media sources from the Democratic Party with most Facebook reactions, comments and shares

The most engaging media sources included in the Free and Equal cluster
are very heterogeneous (Table 5). The top two media sources, left.it and
internazionale.it, are left wing national newsweeklies. The cluster also includes
some blogs maintained by professional journalists (alleyoop.ilsole24ore.com
and francescoluna.com), webzines and online news organizations, such as
estense.com and valigiablu.it. Among the most engaging sources associated
with the Free and Equal community we could also observe wumingfoundation.
com, which is the blog of a collective of authors very close to the Italian radical
left. Finally, the list includes articolo1mdp.it, the website of the progressive and
democratic movement, a political entity related to the Free and Equal party.
In any case, the volume of the interactions is really residual compared with
sources associated to other political parties. It should also be noted that in the
case of internazionale.it and alleyoop.ilsole24ore.com, Facebook posts received
more shares than comments. This is a pattern that we have seen also for some
sources included in the M5S cluster, however, here, the numbers are much
more small.

Table 5: Media sources from Free and Equal party with most Facebook reactions, comments and shares

To conclude this part of the analysis on different engagement metrics on
Facebook, we present in Figure 18 the top 10% most productive media sources
(in term of URLs generated)15 ranked by average Facebook interactions (the
larger chart in the center), shares (top-right), reactions (center-right) and
comments (bottom-right). A comparative look to the three different Facebook
metrics (shares, comments and reactions) shows that, while the distribution
of reactions and shares are very similar (i.e. top shared sources are also those
receiving more reactions), the list of top commented sources offer a different
picture. For instance, ilblogdellestelle.it and beppegrillo.it, while ranking
respectively first and second in term of both share and reactions obtained on
Facebook, do not lead the rank of comments. Conversely repubblica.it, the top
commented source, ranks only third in term of both shares and reactions.


15     We calculated the percentile on media sources URLs production, keeping only the 10%
most productive.

Controversial News Stories and Cross-partisan Engagement

A large majority of Italians claims that mainstream media are biased and the
overall country level of trust in traditional media is low16. The combination
between the distrust toward traditional media and the lack of a centralized
control and traditional gatekeepers of digital media fostered during the last
ten year a strong rhetoric on the supposed freedom of the online information.
The leaders of the Five Stars M      ovement, starting from the founder Beppe
Grillo, leveraged on this distrust to popularize their alternative media outlets
and bolster their own narratives.

In this context, our dataset allow to shed some light on the way partisan
audiences interact with diverse online news stories. In light of the debate on
information eco-chambers, it is interesting to observe how the behaviour of
partisan audiences is affected by the political leaning of the source and its
contents.

In order to do so, we present an in-depth analysis of two highly controversial
and popular investigative report portraying scandals involving politicians
belonging to two different parties. The first case, run by the online only media
outlet Fanpage, illustrates an example of negative coverage for the Democratic
Party. The second, run by Le Iene – a popular TV show aired by the Berlusconi
owned free-to-air channel Italia 1 – is an example of negative coverage for the
Five Stars Movement. Both reports run for several days in the middle of the
electoral campaign.

The Fanpage inquiry called “Bloody Money” is a suitable example of this
practice. During February 2018, fanpage.it shared a serie of videos shot during a
journalistic investigation started by a public call to manage the waste disposal
in Campania region. The report involved Roberto De Luca, the council member
responsible for the budget of the municipality of Salerno, representative of the
Democratic Party and son of the governor of the Campania region, Vincenzo De
Luca. The inquiry was filmed by an hidden camera and carried on with the help
of an infiltrated former mafia boss who got in touch with several politicians. De
Luca junior resigned from his position in the council of the municipality few
days after the investigation was made public. “Bloody Money” lead the Italian
magistrates to investigate for corruption 17 politicians and businessman.

The whole “Bloody Money” investigative report consists of six episodes.
Anticipated by few excerpts released to boost the attention and widely discussed,
the complete video of the first episode was made available on February 16.
The sixth and final complete episode was released on March 24. All the videos
were published by Fanpage on their channels dedicated to videos (youmedia.
fanpage.it) and consequently on their main website.

In order to understand, in light of this case, the behavior of partisan audiences,
we compared the shares of the different typologies of Facebook interactions
(comments, likes and shares) with specific reference to the ratio between
comment and shares of the 50 most engaging media sources. Of those types
of interactions, reactions are the most common followed by comments and
shares. The three signals are highly correlated, with comments being the less
correlated with the others.

Although both belonging to the same outlet and both being boosted by the
success of “Bloody Money” youmedia.fanpage.it and fanpage.it collected a
very different pattern of interaction (Figure 20). On the one hand, youmedia.
fanpage.it is rare example of the category of news media source that collected
overall more shares than comments (33,233 comments and 40,211 shares). This
same category also includes, as prominent representative, the two official M5S
news source. On the other hand, fanpage.it is media source with the highest
disproportion between comments and shares (672,635 comments vs 87,450
shares) in the entire dataset.

Youmedia.fanpage.it domain and its Facebook page, which is described in the
information box as “a selection of best videos and photo galleries edited by
Fanpage.it” hosts very different multimedia content, from video recipes to travel
vlogs to emotional stories of humans and animals. Fanpage.it is a native online
news media organization with an official editorial staff. It discusses different
topics and frequently publishes journalistic inquiries, as well as diverse news. In
the lead of the election fanpage.it covered a wide range of political news stories
including both positive and negative coverage of all different political actors.

The involvement of a politician affiliated to the Democratic Party in a bribery
investigation made this news story particularly suitable to be used by rival
partisan audiences as a proof of the allegation of widespread corruption in that
party. Most probably due to this investigative report, both Fanpage youmedia
and main website significantly catalyzed the attention of M5S supporters.
Consequently both domain are listed in MP-MPAS M5S category. Nevertheless,
the way online audiences interacted with the two news sources are significantly
different.

A more in depth look to the comment/share ratio of the top engaging Fanpage.
it articles in our dataset shed some more light on this patterns (Figure 21).

disobeyed to the party internal rule that requires every M5S MP to reimburse

 The diverging cases of “Bloody Money” and “Rimborsopoli” pointed out
 the usefulness of the comment/share ratio metric in revealing the different
 behaviour of online partisan audiences.
 Figure 24, thus, explores the ratio between comments and shares for the most
 engaging 50 media sources in our dataset. The average comment/share ratio
 of these 50 media sources is 2.212 and a first look to the distribution of colors
 in the chart seems to point out, with the notable exception discussed above of
 Fanpage.it, a clear prevalence of yellow sources (M5S) at the bottom. This first
 impression is further confirmed by Figures 25 to 28. The only category of sources
 with a comment/share ratio below the average is the M5S one. It also worth to
 note that the average score for the League category is slightly lower than the
 average score for PD and Cross-partisan category. An additionally hint pointing
 in the same direction is provided by Figure 29 that displays a list of news media
 sources with a comment/share ratio score below 1. With the exception of Lercio
 (a satirical website), all the other news sources in listed have been adjudicated
 via the MP-MPAS to the Five Stars Movement.

Media Coverage of Election Issues

Observed over time, the online media coverage in the run up of the 2018 Italian
General Election shows, both in terms of the numbers of stories per day and
Facebook engagement, a clear increasing trend from September 2017 until the
Election Day (4th March 2018).


There is a significant difference in the number of online news stories published
immediately before and during the full electoral campaign period – that
formally starts 30 days before the election day, according to Italian legislation
– compared to the previous period: between September and December 2017
there are, on average, about 359 news stories per day, in January 2018 617
news stories per day (+72% compared to the previous period), and in FebruaryMarch there are 684 news stories per day (+91%).

Comments, reactions and shares of news stories on Facebook share the same
trend: in February-March 2018 the average engagement per day is 290% of the
average engagement per day of September 2017, indicating that the audience
engagement grow up as the elections got closer.

In this chapter, we present an analysis of the main topics that have characterized
the news coverage and their Facebook engagement during the six month
before the election day. The chapter is structured as follows: first, we present an
in-depth analysis of the main topics; second, we discuss the ten most engaging
news stories in the entire period of observation; then, we analyse the media

 coverage of the four main candidates and, finally, we present four case studies
 aimed to provide and in-depth description of an emblematic news story for
 each main candidate.

 Engaging days, engaging issues
 Both in the period from September 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018 (pre-campaign)
 and in the period from February 1, 2018 until the election day (campaign), the
 engagement peaked on a limited number of days, and focused on a limited
 number of news stories. Therefore, we have identified the ten days with greater
 engagement in both the periods, and extracted, within these days, the most
 engaging news stories (N = 789) in order to analyse more in depth their content,
 according to the method described in the methodological section of this report
 (see Appendix 1, “Content Analysis” section).
 We analysed the news titles and descriptions of the most engaging news
 stories in the most engaging days, by classifying them through the largely
 accredited categories of “political issues” (dynamics of the political system and
 more abstract spheres of the political competitions), “policy issues” (concrete
 problems that affect citizens closely and that the political system may face
 through specific interventions), “campaign issues” (strategic and organizational
 aspects of the electoral campaign), and “personal issues” (leaders/candidates’
 extra-political qualities and activities). We added the category “news report”
 to classify stories that reported accounts related to some of these issues or
 other topics lacking a clear reference to the Italian political campaign or the
 candidates/parties/coalitions/ideologies.

 These macro categories have been further classified in several subcategories
 (micro issues) that both leveraged on previous scholarship and emerged from
 data17.

 Overall, over 6 months, in the most engaging days, we found a significant
 presence of political issues (35.2%), followed by policy issues (24.9%), campaign
 issues (23.1%), and personal issues (7.5%). News reports characterized the 8.6%
 of the sampled news. Less than 1% of the sample was classified as “other”.

 Interesting differences in the distribution of these categories of issues (and
 relative micro-issues) emerged between the pre-campaign period and the
 month before the Election Days (see Figure 31 and tables in Appendix 4).

The pre-campaign period was dominated by “campaign issues” (33.3%). This
result is due, in particular, to the Sicily Regional elections, held in November
2017, won by the center-right coalition but with a remarkable result of the Five
Stars Movement (M5S). Leveraging on this result, the M5S could encourage the
undecided constituency, in the frame of an electoral law that rewarded broad
consensus (easier to reach for coalitions than for a single party). “Good news: the
5 Star Movement is the only real great political force in the country”, wrote Luigi
Di Maio on beppegrillo.it, obtaining an high engagement in this news category.
Moreover, the deep defeat of Democratic Party (PD) in Sicily led the M5S leader,
Luigi Di Maio, to decline the invite for a public debate programmed with the
PD leader (and former Premier), Matteo Renzi. In the attempt to delegitimize
his opponent, Di Maio claimed he did not recognize Renzi a real competitor
anymore: “Di Maio cancels the TV confrontation with Renzi: «He is no longer the
competitor»”, entitled repubblica.it in one of the most engaging news among
the “campaign issues” category.

These “campaign” news stories – which referred to the local election results
and to the management of TV debate – catalyzed the attention of digital press
and social media audience in the pre-campaign run, along with the news story
concerning Renzi’s “Destination Italy” electoral train tour. According to the
most engaging news stories circulated online at the time, “Destination Italy”
resembled – due the countless protests awaiting at most stations – an “Odyssey”
more than a tour: “Democratic Party, the Renzi’s train travels incognito: to avoid
protests and insults at every stop, the program and dates are canceled”, titled

 the first most engaging news story in this campaign category, published by
 Il Fatto Quotidiano. Also the third most engaging news story of this category,
 by huffingtonpost.it, reports claims against Renzi’s campaign: “Renzi takes a
 political rally in a church. The parish priest: «We didn’t know about it, we are
 upset»”. In the second position, within this macro-category of issue, a satirical
 news story run by lercio.it (similar to the American “The Onion”) claiming that
 the Democratic Party tested his program with monkeys.

 In general, looking at the top ten most engaging news concerning “campaign
 issues”, five were negative coverage of Renzi, including the first three top
 engaging news stories, whereas other two enthusiastically celebrated the
 electoral successes of the M5S in Sicily, and were published by beppegrillo.
 it, the blog of the popular Italian comedian who co-founded, together with
 Gianroberto Casaleggio, the Movement. While the campaign news stories with
 negative coverage of Renzi gained social media popularity, the most engaging
 news stories related to the Five Stars Movement and its leaders were mostly
 published by their official party sources.


 The case of another campaign issue confirmed that the Facebook engagement
 has privileged the positive coverage of the M5S in the pre-campaign period.
 The case refers to the choice of the M5S’s candidates for the General Election
 through an internal referendum, called “Parlamentarie”. According to many
 observers, this process was not entirely transparent, yet these negative news
 stories related to “Parlamentarie” had a low level of engagement on Facebook.
 Furthermore, seven out of the ten most engaging news stories related to
 “Parlamentarie” were published by the Movement’s blogs and defended its
 “honest” image.

The second most prominent category of issues in the pre-campaign period is
the “policy” one (26.4%), wherein the top stories are related to the approval, in
December 2017, of the living-will law, which has aroused considerable interest
online and offline, also because it was a law debated for almost eleven years and
strictly connected to mediatic cases such as those of Piergiorgio Welby, Eluana
Englaro and, more recently, dj Fabo, all persons who, along with their familiars
and politicians of the Radical Party, have fought for the right to euthanasia, in
a country like Italy, where Catholic religion – which reveres life as sacred – has a
great influence due to historical, cultural and political reasons.


Within the “policy” news, also the eviction of “Grandma Peppina” has had
particular resonance in the pre-campaign period. Peppina, a 95 years old
woman affected by the earthquake that struck central Italy who was denied an
accomodation, quickly become an iconic media character of the early afternoon
TV shows representing the needy neglected by the State. Together with the
story of “Peppina”, other news related to government’s policies highlighted,
more or less directly, the inability of the State to provide the right assistance
to the weakest citizens. Nevertheless, supported by a rhetoric that makes
personalization the main tool to arouse empathy and identification in the
audience, the “Grandma Peppina” case was the news story that best catalyzed
this idea.

Other engaging news about “policy issues” such as the problem of the
missed abrogation of the MPs’ life annuity (so called “vitalizi”) reinforced the
representation of a deep distance between the (privileged) political class and
the citizens. The M5S has fought hard against these privileges and, more in
general, against the “high costs” of politics, establishing an internal rule that
obliges its MPs to give back a part of their salary in favour of a micro-credit fund.
The Movement dominated the news related to the case of “vitalizi”. The top

 it: “#NoiRinunciamoAlPrivilegio (“we renounce to the privilege”). The D-Day of
 the parties has come. Today deputies and senators have matured their privileged
 pension, while all the other Italian citizens will be forced to work for who knows
 how many years to get a poor pension treatment”. This populist communicative
 style is typical of the M5S, which represents itself as a honest new political force
 that fight against the old, corrupt political class, for the benefit of ordinary
 citizens.

 Also the news concerning “political issues” in the pre-campaign period (21.5%)
 were characterized by this populist narrative. In particular, the most engaging
 stories in this macro category deal with legal issues and corruption. More
 specifically, several news stories mention the allegation moved by the M5S’s
 leaders to Silvio Berlusconi and other members of his party to be in contact
 with the Mafia.


 Another relevant topic concerns the scandals involving banks, Renzi, and other
 exponents of the Democratic Party. While articles about the arrest of a M5S
 candidate in the Sicilian elections also appear in this micro category, the top
 engaging story is focused on Matteo Renzi, who showed his bank account
 balance during a TV show, in the attempt to demonstrate his transparency in
 the “bank affair”. Renzi’s gesture indicates that the M5S’s “campaign for honesty”
 has been able to condition the other candidates’ political moves.

 In the (more residual) “personal issue” category of this pre-campaign period
 (9.9%), we found many news stories reporting personal attacks to Luigi Di Maio,
 pointing to his lack of political experience, the fact he is not holding an higher
 education degree, and a grammatical mistake he made during an interview. The
 attacks came from his political opponents, especially Vittorio Sgarbi, a centerMAPPING ITALIAN NEWS MEDIA POLITICAL COVERAGE IN THE LEAD-UP OF 2018 GENERAL ELECTION

right politician and TV star well known for his provocative communication
style, and also from the foreign press. Within this category, we also observed
engaging news stories about the mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, exponent
of the M5S, who dedicated her time to assist an ill child on a metro. Laura
Boldrini and Matteo Salvini are protagonists of other news concerning personal
insults. Boldrini, a left-wing politician, outgoing President of the Chamber of
Deputies and former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has
indeed become a target of right-wing politicians and their supporters for her
immigration policy. For this reason, an article published in January gathered a
considerable attention around the story of some League activists who burned a
puppet that depicted Boldrini at the helm of a ship carrying migrants. Boldrini’s
rebuttal also ignited the interest of the online publics when she labelled the
League leader as “disgusting”.

Immigration policies was a common trail of pre and campaign in the lead of
the election. It is the first policy issue in the whole sample of the most engaging
news, both for media coverage and
for total engagement. This topic was

between political candidates and parties oriented towards openness to migrant
and refugees, like the above-mentioned Laura Boldrini or the Democratic Party
of Matteo Renzi, and those that pursue more strict policies, like the League of
Matteo Salvini. Curiously, in the pre-campaign period, the news story about
immigration with more engagement is not dedicated to Salvini, but to the
Democratic Party, and once again it is not a positive story. The story support an
allegation of hypocrisy in matters of immigration policies through a particular,
private, case: “«I love a refugee of color», and his mother, a PD mayor and
supporter of immigrants rights: «you’re sick»”.


The official campaign period was immediately marked by a series of events
deeply connected with immigration. The campaign period starts, in fact, with
the racist raid in Macerata. The raid was executed by a former Northern League

 candidate, Luca Traini, and the episode immediately turned from a news report
 into a policy issue. Due to the relevance of such news reports, during the official
 campaign period, “policy issues” were less than in the previous phase (23.4%).
 More than a third of the news referring to policy issues focused on the microissue of immigration because of the aforementioned racist raid. Indeed, after
 this raid, many journalists, intellectuals like Roberto Saviano, and political
 opponents, judged the League leader Matteo Salvini morally responsible for the
 crime because of his violent speeches in support of anti-immigration policies.
 Salvini replied to the accusations by reaffirming his position: “Shooting Macerata,
 Salvini: «The invasion of migrants leads to social conflict». The secretary of the
 League: «Anyone who shoots is a criminal. But an immigration out of control
 leads to social conflict»”. The letter written by an adoptive mother of two
 African children, who accused Salvini of provoking, through his solutions, racist
 attitudes in the population, has also attracted the attention of social media:
 “The adoptive mother of two children writes to Salvini: «You make my children
 live in terror, thank you»”.


 Before and during the official campaign, immigration was a micro issue with
 a significant presence also in “news reports”, concerning 18 out of 68 news
 included in this macro category.18In 14 of these news reports, immigration
 was connected to episodes of violence and crimes perpetrated by immigrants.
 In some cases, these episodes became expedients, for the League advocates,
 to back their anti-immigrants policies. An example is the case of immigrants

traveling on public buses without a ticket: “Italy is hostage, free bus to
immigrants to avoid violent reactions. Immigrants travel for free, policemen
forced to buy tickets for them on the buses of Agrigento: the complaint comes
from the Sicilian secretary of the League, Pagano”. News reports dealing with
immigration (referring statistics, speaking of good actions by immigrants, and
describing the troubles immigrants face) are very few. Yet, it is just one of these
news reports that gained, in absolute, the highest engagement we recorded in
the entire period of observation (see below paragraph).

Immigration sparked and re-ignited ideological divisions, leading to prominence,
particularly during the official campaign, of the fascism/anti-fascism discourses,
a still open historical political fracture of Italian society, that contributed to
the significant presence of political issues in the latest phase of observation.
The culprit of the Macerata raid was openly supported by right-wing and farright parties. At the same time, it led to street demonstrations against violence,
race discrimination and thus fascism. During an anti-fascist protest organized
in response to a rally of the far-right party CasaPound, a teacher wished death
to the policemen that protected the area. An engaging news in this context
is related to a declaration of Matteo Renzi: “Professor to the policemen: «You
must die». Renzi: «She must be fired»”.


Beyond immigration, the “policy issue” that gathered the highest volume of
interactions (in the sampled days of the official campaign, as well as in the
overall period of observation, see below) is related to economics and largely
caused by this news: “Unpaid electric bills will be (partially) at the expense
of the other consumers”. Many news within this micro category referred also
to the troubles of pensioners and the need to change the law that regulates
retirements.

There were also news on local policies, mainly related to the Rome and Turin
M5S mayors, respectively Virginia Raggi and Chiara Appendino. These news

     Elezioni - 2018
Mapping Italian News


stories mainly reports the successes of the M5S local administrators, and almost
half of these articles came from sources directly related to the Movement.

As regards the prominent category of “political” issue (49.5%), in the campaign
period the most engaging micro issue was related to institutional candidacies
and possibile form of government. Statements on the institutional candidacies
are news stories mainly related to M5S. Indeed, Luigi Di Maio presented a
list of ministers, an unconventional choice, since Italy has a parliamentary
system and the ministers are thus formally nominated by the President. This
unconventional move responded both to the allegation of lack of competence
of M5S leadership and resonated with the narrative of “honesty” supported
through attacks to the “crooked” establishment. Within the “political” issues
in the campaign period, the most engaging news story – written by Luigi Di
Maio himself and published by ilblogdellestelle.it – was in fact the presentation
of the team selected to join the future government: “It is with great pride that
today I present you a government team that is a National Heritage. I am proud
of the absolute excellence of this team of men and women who are making
themselves available to Italians. This is a historical event. For the first time in
the history of the Republic a government team proposal is presented before
the elections”.


Among the “political issues”, scandals and corruption also attracted a lot of online
attention in the campaign period. The topics of this micro category concerned
both an inquiry on the corruption of PD members in Campania region and the
allegations of collusion with the Mafia moved by M5S to Berlusconi. Nevertheless,
the majority of news in this category focuses on M5S and its “Rimborsopoli”
scandal. According to an internal rule, the M5S MPs are required to pay part of
their income to a microcredit fund. However, an investigative report carried out
by a very popular TV show unveiled multiple violation of this rule. Several news
stories are dedicated to this topic, potentially hitting the M5S at the hearth
of its political identity, based on the honesty in contrast to the old, corrupt,
political class. While the majority of articles focuses on this scandal, the most

engaging news story in the category is once again from ilblogdellestelle.it: “The
court of Rome backs Virginia Raggi up: unfounded criminal record!”.

As the election day got closer, within the “campaign issues” (12.2%), news
coverage focused on conversations caught off-air between the exponents of
the center-right coalition on the electoral results and demonstrations against
candidates during their campaign tour, like Matteo Renzi, Giorgia Meloni (the
leader of Italian Brothers), and Matteo Salvini. The latter was specifically criticized
for his campaign in the south of Italy that sharply contrasted with the League’
traditional discourses on defending the rights of the economically productive
north against the “widespread” corruption of the south. Another news story in
this category is that of Berlusconi signing a “contract with the Italians” during
the popular political TV show “Porta a Porta”, the program where he performed,
17 years before, the same symbolic scene.


The “personal issues” category of the campaign period contains less news
stories compared to the same category of the pre-campaign period (4.9%).
However, also in this phase, 3 of the 10 most engaging news concerned the
personal attacks/insults from Vittorio Sgarbi to Di Maio, and other 2 of these
stories criticize M5S’ affiliates. The other two main characters of these engaging
personal issues, were Berlusconi (with his attitudes towards women) and Salvini
(criticized by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage for his low cultural level, and at
the centre of a dispute around his music preference).

The agenda that emerges from the news stories that gathered most attention
in the lead up of the election are thus characterized by multiple micro issues
sharing a set of commons trails. The first prominent narrative pertains the fight

between the “crooked”/“privileged” political class – involved in scandals and
legal issues – and the citizens – unemployed, victims of increasing taxation,
natural disasters that the State is not able to face, and the pension reform. This
distance was a favourable terrain for the engaging self-communicated news of
the Five Stars Movement, particularly the ones delegitimizing the opponents
(mainly Berlusconi and Renzi), as well as the ones announcing the Movement’s
“honest” and “competent” candidates. Moreover, the most engaging news of the
most engaging day depicted an agenda wherein the policies about immigration
and reports of crimes perpetrated by immigrants have been a dominant microissue, that cannibalized almost a third of the sampled news concerning policy
issue and news reports, particularly as the Election Day got closer, because of
a racist raid that brought fascism/anti-fascism back at the core of the Italian
political and media agenda.


The top 10 most engaging news in the lead up of the election
In the previous section, we presented an in depth analysis of the issues covered
by the most engaging news published in a limited number of days, during both
the pre-campaign period and the official campaign phase, as during these days
we registered the highest peaks of engagement. When we turn to the whole
period of observation, we can observe that while the large majority of the
issues have been covered in the sample, there are few significant exceptions. In
order to underline these expectations, we thus focus in this section on the 10
news stories that have been, overall, most commented, reacted, and shared on
Facebook over the mapped six months (see tables in Appendix 2). This focus
enable us also to analyse in-depth the sources, the micro/macro categories of
issues, and the content of the most “spreadable” news.

newsworthy offline events occurred in September (a judge’s decision), December
(the approval of a new law), and January (the coming into force of a new law).

Seven of these 10 top news have been published during the most engaging
days we sampled in the previous section. The three exceptions occupy the sixth,
the seventh and the last position in this rank.

In the first position, we find the most engaging news we classified as “news
report” about immigration. Specifically, it is an excerpt from the popular Italian
TV music festival (“Sanremo”), aired when the official electoral campaign was
started. It has been published by the YouTube channel of the public service
Television (Rai) and refers to a monologue performed during the festival telling

of the troubles of an immigrant who escapes from the war in the country of
origin. It is an exemplar case of “pop politics”, that is, a hybrid genre of political
communication, wherein the products of popular culture feature political
issues.


Also the second most engaging news has been classified as “news report”,
and also in this case the protagonist is one of the hosts of Sanremo TV music
festival, Claudio Baglioni, a very popular singer. This news recalls one of the
policy issues covered during the period of observation, that is, the troubles of
the Italians damaged by the earthquakes. Yet, as well as in the previous case,
the information is not directly related to the policies activated to solve these
problems. It instead reports a donation that the singer did to the victims of the
earthquake. It has been published two days after the end of the festival, and
after the criticism against the hosts’ wealthy cachets. The original source is an
online newspaper that deals with journeys – and which declares two different
dates of registrations in two different local tribunals. This news represents
a case of “problematic information”. Indeed its generic title and the date of
publication could mislead, suggesting a connection between Sanremo’s cachet
and the donation. Yet, within the article, an old news is recalled: a charity
concert Baglioni did two years before, in 2016. After its publication, the news
was labeled as “fake” by the other newspapers, even if the content was true.
Given the “problematic” nature of this popular news, the singer’s press office
published a clarification.

The third position among the most engaging news stories is reached by a
piece covering a policy issue, and in particular the micro issue of taxes. It was
published by a leading economic newspaper (“Il Sole24Ore”) and explains a
decision formalized by the Authority for Energy, in January 2018, on the base of
the State Council’s and Administrative Court’s sentences: a part of the electric

companies’ outstanding debt will be distribute among the consumers who
regularly pay for energy. In this case, unlike the previous two cases, the news
refers to a public intervention on one of the problems that citizens face in their
everyday life. Published three weeks before the Election Day, this news story
presents the second most high percentage of comments (with a significant
difference as compared with the average).

The four most engaging news story dates back to December 2017, when the
law on the living will law was approved by the Italian Senate. It covers this
policy issue, as well as the news story that occupies the ninth position in this
top 10. The original sources, in both cases, are two leading national newspaper
(“La Repubblica” and “Il Fatto quotidiano”). Both sources underline the decisive
role of the collaboration between Democratic Party and Five Stars Movement.
The articles report press releases, tweets, and Facebook posts by politicians and
institutional exponents who had different opinions about this legislative change,
along with the statements of other public figures and relatives of patients
engaged in the struggle for the right to interrupt the medical treatments in the
final phases of the disease. Moreover, the articles embed videos (La Repubblica)
and slideshare file (Il Fatto quotidiano) that explain what the law envisages. “La
Repubblica” inserts also links to an in-depth analysis on the other reforms that
the Cabinet “must not betray”, while “Il Fatto Quotidiano” reserves more space
to the long path of this law, giving voice to video declarations of the activists
who presented a petition to ask the Senate’s President for the immediate
approval of the law, before the General Election.
The fifth more engaging news story refers to a “political issue”, and in particular
to the legal issues that involved an important representative of the Five Stars
Movement, Virginia Raggi. In 2017, Raggi was under investigation for some
positions she filled at the beginning of her experience as mayor of Rome. The
investigation on Virginia Raggi was a threat to the credibility of the whole Five
Stars Movement – which leverages on the renewal of the “crooked” political class.
In February 2018, ten days before the general elections, Raggi communicates
that the Court of Rome has dismissed the lawsuit. While she had published
the same news directly on her Facebook Profile, the source of this fifth more
engaging news story on Facebook was the Five Stars Movement blog (“Il Blog
delle Stelle”).

At the sixth position, among the top 10 most engaging news stories, we find
a news that was published in one of the day that did not register a peak of
engagement, and exactly before the Election Day. It was an hoax published in

“pay-off” plays “online daily newspaper”. Looking at this source, a click baiting

the credibility of the news, precise references to concrete places (city, street)
have been provided, along with the reference to a phantom “electoral police”.
To increase its veracity, the news includes an “update” (without indicating any
dates): the guilty party is a typographer who had copied by mistake a prefilled electoral ballot, abandoning them in the street. From a different source
and with different geographic references, the same hoax spread during the
campaign for the constitutional referendum in 2016 and during the Local
Elections in 2017. Compared to the other 10 news, the structure of engagement
for this story present the highest number of comments (which represent one
third of the total engagement generated by this news), but also the second
highest percentage of shares (with a significant difference as compared with
the average).

The seventh position in the top 10 of the most engaging news is also occupied
by a news story that was published in one of the day that did not register
a peak of engagement. The source is, again, the leading newspaper “Il Fatto
Quotidiano”. This piece – which was published three weeks before the Elections
Day – covers a micro category of policy issue that did not emerge as relevant
during the most engaging days, that is, European policies and their effects
on Italian economy. More specifically, mixing a video reportage and a written
article, the story refers to the troubles that Sicilian farmers face to cultivate
the “red gold” of Pachino, that is, a type of tomato that grows up only in the
south of the island. In this news story, the farmers raised an allegation to the
European Union, explaining why it is difficult to compete with the costs of
the products that come from Africa because of the commercial agreements
between EU and North African countries. Moreover, the interviewed farmers
criticized the Italian Minister Martina for his lack of commitment in facing this
problem within the European Commission. Compared with the other 10 news,
this story is the most shared.

The story of “grandma Peppina”, an earthquake victim who became the symbol
of the inertia of the State, is covered by the eighth most engaging news story,
published by a local newspaper. The article explains that a small little house
had been built to her by the daughters, after the earthquake that destroyed
her previous one. The new house, however, was considered a building abuse.
For this reason, in September 2017 the old lady had been forced to abandon it
and move elsewhere. The news – enhanced by photos of a weeping “grandma
Peppina” who leaves her house – reports the claim of Peppina’s daughter: “Today
the State is dead”.
As we already said, in the ninth position there is another news story about the

living will law approval, and in the last position of this rank of engaging news,
we find another story that was not published during one of the most engaging
days. And, also in this case, the covered issue is a policy one. Specifically, the
article was published by a magazine that deals with music, pop culture, and
politics (“Rolling Stone”), and it is a comment around a law that came into
force at the beginning of January, introducing a cost of few cents for the
biodegradable bags used to buy fruits and vegetables. This aspect of the law
raised harsh criticism on social media, timely covered by the traditional media
in the algorithmic turn of the news values. Yet, the article that has reached the
tenth position in this rank is a written and video reportage on the pollution that
is invading Bali’s beaches because of the plastic bags. Thus, despite the polemics
covered by traditional media, the news story which gained more attention on
Facebook about this issue endorsed the Italian legislative initiative.

one or more leaders of the four main parties. The most mentioned politician
is Matteo Renzi, followed by Silvio Berlusconi, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio
(Figure 32).


Despite being the less mentioned leader, articles featuring Luigi Di Maio
were widely popular on Facebook. The overall total engagement for the news
stories about Di Maio is second only to the engagement reached by the news
mentioning Renzi, with a tiny difference of 0.78%. It’s a striking result obtained
with 35% less dedicated news stories. If we compare the engagement of the
news stories mentioning Di Maio with those dedicated to Salvini – who had a
comparable media coverage (8.3% more news than Di Maio) – the difference
remains considerable (see Figure 33).

The engagement achieved by news stories citing Di Maio is also noteworthy
if we bear in mind that news specifically mentioning a politician or a party
in their title or description tend to be less engaging than other types of news
stories. Indeed, on average, the issues mentioning politicians received about
700 interactions against the 908 of the other types of news stories. Di Maio’s
news stories reach about 1,043 interactions on average, while the average
engagement per news of the other main candidates is closest to the average
of their category: 684 for Berlusconi, 687 for Renzi, 790 for Salvini (see Table 6).

the presentation of the list of members of a potential government lead by the
Movement.


These data show that, despite a relative lower digital media coverage, the leader
of the Five Stars Movement, compared to the other candidates, has been able
to conquer a successful and exclusive mediatic space.

We found another significant difference between the news stories mentioning Di
Maio and the ones paying attention to other candidates. The stories mentioning
Di Maio associate less often, in their titles and descriptions, his name to the
one of his competitors. While Di Maio’s name is mentioned together with (an)
other leader(s) only in the 19.3% of the cases, this happens for Berlusconi in the
30.5% of the cases, for Salvini in the 25.1% of the cases, and for Renzi in the
23.5% of the cases.


Top issues by leader
To outline a profile of the media and digital media presence of the main
candidates, we performed a cluster analysis of the titles and descriptions of
the news stories pertinent to them, extracting the ten most significant groups
of news stories following to the methods described in the methodological
section. Then, we classified the clusters of news stories according to the macro
and micro categories of issues presented above.

Silvio Berlusconi
The clusters of news stories related to Silvio Berlusconi are mainly related
to “political issues”. Specifically, five clusters of news are related to political
issues and within these, two clusters are related to legal issues, two are related
to institutional candidacies and government formulas, and one to alliances,
coalitions and governability.

                                                                                            Mapping Italian News


The political cluster with greater engagement concerns, in particular, legal
issues. The news stories related to these issues concern the allegations of
Berlusconi’s collusion with the Mafia, and include, in particular, many attacks
from the main representatives of the Five Stars Movement, Luigi Di Maio and
Alessandro Di Battista. The most engaging news story in this cluster is an attack
from Luigi Di Maio that titled: “Di Maio to Berlusconi: «We make wire transfers
to Italian companies, you made them to the Mafia»” (see the case study on
Berlusconi for a focus on this news story).

The “policy issues” category include three clusters of news stories, that, overall,
reach the highest media coverage. All these three clusters are about economics
and fiscal policy. A news cluster is about “Flat Tax”, another on “basic income”,
that is, the political proposals that characterized Berlusconi’s electoral campaign.
The last is about the “Fornero law”, a recent and very contested law that regulates
retirements in Italy. As regards this last issue, some conflicts between Berlusconi
and his ally, Matteo Salvini, emerge. Indeed, Salvini promises to radically abolish
the “Fornero law”, and not to modify it, as, instead, Berlusconi proposes.

Also the “campaign issue” has had some relevance, with two clusters. One is
related to the party symbol presented by Silvio Berlusconi on Twitter. Within the
symbol, there was the written slogan “Berlusconi for President”, even though
he was not candidable because of his conviction for fiscal fraud: the news
became then object of debate. The other “campaign issue” cluster concerns the
clamorous contestation of a “Femen” activist in topless at the polling station

where the former Prime Minister was voting. The protester jumped on a table
in front of Berlusconi and shouted: “Your time is up, Berlusconi!”.

Luigi Di Maio
“Political issues” characterize the clusters of news stories related to Luigi Di
Maio, with six clusters of news stories: one is related to alliances, coalitions and
governability, another to institutional candidacies and forms of government
and four to legal issues. Therefore, also in the case of Di Maio, as in that of
Berlusconi, the news stories concerning legal issues are prominent. However,
there is a relevant difference: while in the case of Berlusconi the news stories
mainly concern his legal issues, in the case of Di Maio they are mainly related
to his attacks against the old and corrupted political class. Indeed, two clusters
out four include news stories on the “Bancopoli” scandals, that is the scandals
that linked eminent representatives of the Democratic Party, including Matteo
Renzi, to banks affairs; the third is related to another inquiry on the corruption,
again, of the Democratic Party politicians, in this case those of the Campania
region. Another cluster on legal issues, however, is about a candidate of the Five
Stars Movement under investigation for money laundering, and thus expelled
from the party.

The other two political clusters of news concer the internal changes to the party,
like the Beppe Grillo steps aside from the party and the possible governmental
collaborations with other parties, traditionally firmly refused by the Movement,
and to institutional candidacies, related to the unconventional presentation of
a list of potential ministers. Both this two groups of news stories has conveyed
a more or less implicit, but politically meaningful, communicative message.
Indeed, the Five Stars Movement has always been accused to be dependent
from its charismatic leader Beppe Grillo and to lack basic competences among
its representatives. Beppe Grillo progressive distancing from the party during
the electoral campaign and the presentation of lists of academics, intellectual,
sportsman and journalists as its “super-competent team” disempowered both
long standing critics.

Other two clusters of news stories concerns “personal issues”. The first is related
to the controversy with the centre-right politician Vittorio Sgarbi who was
the direct opponent of Di Maio in the constituency of Pomigliano (Campania
region). The second is related to the personal qualities of Luigi Di Maio, that
by participating in the traditional Catholic liturgy of San Gennaro, patron of
Naples, present himself as a person linked to the traditional religious values
as well as to the culture of southern Italy, where the Movement obtained a
considerable electoral success.

Matteo Renzi
The clusters of news stories related to Matteo Renzi are equally distributed
between “campaign issue” and “political issues”, each with four clusters of
news. The news related to the “campaign issues” reach, overall, the greatest
engagement, and they concern the campaign activities of the Democratic Party
candidate. Within these campaign issues, the cluster with the highest Facebook
engagement is about the cancellation of the TV debate with the opponent Luigi
Di Maio, following the electoral defeat of the PD at the regional elections in Sicily.
A second cluster of news stories concerns the contested Renzi’s train electoral
tour. The last two clusters in the “campaign issues” category concern, the first,
the presentation of the party program, and the second, the participation of
Renzi at the main Democratic Party festival, the “Unity Party”. The top engaging
news of this last cluster is, once again, negative coverage: “At the National Unity
Party in Imola is the desert”.

In the “political issues” category there are two clusters on legal problems
and corruption, one cluster on fascism and anti-fascism, and a last cluster on
institutional candidacies and government formulas.

We have already seen the news stories related to legal issues, since they are about
the unclear relation between eminent representatives of the Democratic Party
and banks, an issue that clearly emerges also in the political communication
of M5S. Also the other political issue on institutional candidacies is related to
banks, since it has mainly to do with the appointment of the head of the Bank
of Italy.

The last cluster of news stories concerns the antifascist positions of the
Democratic Party and its leader, that can be also read in the light of the racist
raid of Macerata, that have created, as we have seen, a political climate that
led parties and their leader to stress their ideological position. This antifascist
claims can also be seen as a tentative of ideological realignment on the left
positions by the leader of the Democratic Party, whose political career has been
characterized by both a multi-party government with the right-wing forces and
a clash with some left-wing groups that led to a scission. However, this cluster
of news stories did not reach a significant volume of Facebook engagement.

Matteo Salvini
The cluster of news stories related to Matteo Salvini concerned mainly “policy
issues” and “campaign issues”. Two out of four clusters classified as “policy
issues” are about immigration, one is about economics and fiscal policy, and
the last one is on policy over health. The most engaging cluster of news stories
is about the racist raid in Macerata and the allegations to the leader of the
League to be the “moral instigator” of the crime, because of his anti-immigrant
stances. Another cluster of news directly related to immigration policies is

the one about the initiatives of the League against the law on the “ius soli”
(birthright citizenship). Another cluster within the “policy issues” category is
related to policy over health, specifically about the cancellation of the law on
vaccination, that has been an object of great debate in Italy, both offline and on
the social media. The last cluster in the policy issue concerned another central
theme of the electoral campaign of Matteo Salvini, that is, the abrogation of the
“Fornero law” on retirement pensions.


Three clusters of news stories are about “campaign issues”. The first cluster is
about the Salvini’s swearing on the Gospel, an highly symbolic gesture that
strengthen the conservative image of the League candidate, and traces a sacred
boundary against immigrants from other religions. The other two clusters are
related to the new political strategy of the League, that removed the “North”
from its name to seek electoral support also in the south Italy.

The two clusters on “political issues” are about alliances with Silvio Berlusconi
and Giorgia Meloni (Italy Brothers) and manifestation against him by anti-fascist
groups.
The last cluster, regarding “personal issues”, is indirectly concerned with
immigration. It is about insults, violences and aggressions between politicians,
and more specifically between Laura Boldrini, a left-wing politician who has
become a symbols of the policies in favour of immigrations, and the League
leader and his supporters.


Case studies
The following section analyzes the news stories with the highest volume of
interactions in the most engaging cluster for each candidate. The four news
stories represent, each in its unique way, emblematic examples of issues

     Elezioni - 2018

 that characterized the electoral campaign of the candidates and successfully
 catalyzed both audience and media attention.

 In the case of Matteo Salvini the news story is a report on the “policy issue” of
 immigration, related to the racist raid in Macerata on February 3, 2018; in the
 case of Matteo Renzi is a “campaign issue” concerning the TV debate canceled
 by his M5S opponent after the electoral debacle of the Democratic Party in Sicily;
 in the case of Di Maio is a “personal issue” about his extra-political qualities, that
 have been targeted by the right-wing politician Vittorio Sgarbi, and lastly, in the
 case of Silvio Berlusconi, is a “political issue” pertaining his legal issues, which
 has become the main target of attacks coming from the Five Stars Movement
 leaders Luigi Di Maio and Alessandro Di Battista.

 It is worth to notice that the two stories related to Renzi and Berlusconi also
 mention Five Stars Movement’s representatives. It is an additional evidence
 supporting the idea, already pointed out in previous sections, that M5S
 successfully shaped the media agendas about their opponents. Interestingly,
 the only case analyzed not mentioning the Movement is the racist raid of
 Macerata. In the attempt to avoid being labeled as extremist, the Five Stars
 Movement constantly keeped a low profile on divisive topics such immigration.

 Beside representing relevant issues of each candidate and exemplifying some
 dynamics at plays between the candidates, the engagement these news stories
 reached on Facebook suggests that they were able to hit the users of this social
 media, probably because of political and socio-cultural reasons, including
 reasons specifically linked to Internet culture. Let’s look now more in depth at
 these news stories


 Silvio Berlusconi and his legal issues
 The most engaging news story related to Silvio Berlusconi is a “political issue”
 concerning his relationship with the Mafia. It is an article published by fanpage.
 it two weeks before the election day – on February 24, 2018, and its title is: “Di
 Maio to Berlusconi: «We give our money to italian companies, you gave it to
 Cosa Nostra (“the Mafia”, ndr)»”.
 The article is mainly about the statements by Luigi Di Maio against Berlusconi.
 It is worth to notice that the murky past of the former Premier, his political
 power and his economic interests have made Berlusconi, rather than a political
 competitor, the very symbol of corruption that affects the political elite,
 according to the Five Stars Movement.

 The headline of the article quotes the accusations of the Five Stars Movement
 candidate and no Berlusconi’s answer. This missing element is a key one in order
 to understand the role of Silvio Berlusconi in this news story: just an object of

                                                                                            Mapping Italian News


communication, used as a term of comparison in order to talk about the Five
Stars Movement, positioning and valorizing it by disqualifying, simultaneously,
the competitor. So, we find a news story where a very prominent politician –
Berlusconi – is dominated by the Five Stars Movement leader, who was capable
to catch the spotlights and dominate the agenda. Di Maio didn’t had to arrange
any sophisticated strategic move, he just referred to the court’s sentences on
Berlusconi.


In this case, the populist rhetoric “us vs. them” also emerges. Following the
headline we can see how the Five Stars Movement is depicted as honest and
careful about citizens’ interests, while the candidate Berlusconi is described
as a dishonest politician who didn’t care about the people, but just about his
personal interest. Then, in the subheading, there is just a repetition of what
already written in the headline, using longer quotes. Even in the subheading
the main actor and the only voice who’s been reported is Luigi Di Maio’s.

The article is then organized in three sections: the first one, the introduction,
presents the only topic of the headline, that is the controversy between Di Maio
and Berlusconi; the second one is about Di Maio’s critics toward the Democratic
Party; the third is about a video call between Di Maio and Di Battista which was
uploaded online on their Instagram accounts.

In the first section there is a picture of Di Maio seated in the studio of a TV show
and in the text the journalist explains, by quoting him, that his statements

     Elezioni - 2018
Mapping Italian News


 were an answer to the accusation by Silvio Berlusconi that Five Stars Movement
 “learned stealing in a short time”. The main themes around which those
 statements revolve are honesty and corruption, and it is interesting to notice
 that he talked about “stealing” as an activity that the Five Stars Movement
 “learned”, unwittingly implying that it is an usual activity in politics, while his
 opponents immediately used this attack in order to recall Berlusconi’s judiciary
 events, so to underline the difference between the M5S and the old political
 class.

 In the second section, the reported quotes are about the Democratic Party and
 Forza Italia, described as not transparent, or in other words not completely
 honest. Honesty is a central theme in the political narratives of the Five Stars
 Movement, recurring several times as a key element. It is also worth to notice
 that the article, when mentioning statements from other politicians, does
 not report their quotes. Instead, they are mentioned by Di Maio himself or by
 a generic reference to external links. In this way the only protagonist is the
 candidate of the Five Stars Movement.

 The last part of the article is about the video call between Di Maio and Di
 Battista, during which – it is reported by quotes – they comment the bad news
 coverage they got and how badly they were “attacked” by other parties. Then,
 the article ends with the announcement that they will present some names of
 their team during a TV show they will attend.
 Constructing the article in this way suggest implicitly that, despite all the
 criticisms and attacks from the other, dishonest, politicians, they are still going
 further, and they are the only hope of renewal of Italian politics.

 Finally looking at the engagement structure of this news story we found that
 there are more reactions (68%) compared to the average volume of reactions
 of the news stories about Berlusconi (59%), and less comments (18% vs. 29%),
 while the shares are only a little above the average (14% vs 12%). The low
 volume of comments and the ratio between comments and the other metrics
 is perfectly aligned with the trend observed for negative stories covering the
 opponents of the Movement and thus back the analysis presented in the
 paragraph “Controversial News Stories and Cross-partisan Engagement”.

 Di Maio and the provocation of Vittorio Sgarbi
 The most engaging news story related to Luigi Di Maio is not a traditional article
 but a video containing attacks to the M5S candidate that target his personal
 qualities. The source of this news story is InformazioneVera (“True Information”),
 and the news has been published on the election day - March 4, 2018. Its title
 is: “Sgarbi wishes death to Di Maio: «Shall your heart explode, broken ass». Then
 he insults Southern italy electors - WATCH AND SHARE”.

This content is representative of the Di Maio’s campaign because he received
many personal attacks from political opponents, mainly centred on personal
accusations about his lack of instruction, competences and political experience.
It also thematise a central point of the M5S programs, that is basic income.
Indeed Sgarbi, a well-known art critic and right-wing politician, during the
video offends Southern voters by accusing them of laziness and sloth, which
would be strengthened by the basic income, according to him as well as to
many others political opponents of the M5S.


This content is composed by just an headline, a video and a short description.
Even though the video is published by InformazioneVera, it was originally
created and shared online by Vittorio Sgarbi on his Facebook page. The
operation of ripping off videos from their original context to republish them
is a typical practice of clickbaiting driven websites. Another peculiarity of this
kind of websites is the use of capital letters in the headline, to underline the
urgency of a call to action – in this case, to invite the audience to watch and
share the video.

In the video, Sgarbi insults Di Maio multiple times with a colorful language
and the headline summarizes his statements and quotes the most powerful
sentence in order to catch audience’s attention. Reading the short description
following the video, however, it is possible to understand that the point of view
is against Sgarbi, who “has to be denounced”. The contrast is about the Di Maio’s
personal deficiencies alleged by an expert politician. According to this rhetoric
old politicians have values and competencies while newcomers like Di Maio

and most M5S leaders are unprepared and thus not suitable to lead a country.
Exactly in reply to this kind of accusation, the M5S has organized an electoral
campaign centred on “super-competent” candidates.

Vittorio Sgarbi was the direct competitor of Luigi Di Maio in the constituency
of Pomigliano d’Arco in the Campania region of the south of Italy. It is worth
to notice that Vittorio Sgarbi have builded, during his long career of TV-star
art critic, a controversial image of himself, first through television and today
through his videos on social media. On several occasions he publically used
offensive language, excessive expressions and tones, which are today part of
the public figure of Sgarbi: controversial, competent in art and provoking. For
all this reasons, from the point of view of a M5S supporter, a sharp offensive
critic coming from Vittorio Sgarbi lacks any real damaging potential and can
be easily reframed. Nevertheless, the tactic used by InformazioneVera to exploit
the popularity of Sgarbi to bolster the image of Five Stars Movement using a
critical content produced by Sgarbi himself is revealing of the style of certain
alternative news media sources.

In line to what observed in the previous sections (paragraph “Controversial
News Stories and Cross-partisan Engagement”), this critical content toward
M5S collected an unusually high proportion of comments (44.6%) both for Di
Maio’s subset (32%) and for the entire dataset (26%). Furthermore, the share of
comments pass those of reactions (43.8%) on this news story.


Matteo Renzi and the canceled TV debate
The title of the most engaging news story related to the candidate Matteo
Renzi is: “Di Maio cancels the TV debate with Renzi: «He’s not the competitor
anymore». The secretary of the Democratic Party: «He’s afraid»”. This news story
is emblematic of the categories of articles mentioning Matteo Renzi mainly
because of the communicative dynamics it represents. The former prime
minister appears here as a “victim” rather than a “protagonist”, due to the
various attacks coming from political competitors both external and internal
to his party. The criticism against the leader of the Democratic Party recurres
in many other top engaging news stories related to Matteo Renzi, and just as
he has been de-legitimized by the adversary, he has also been de-legitimized
by some internal members of his party, during an unsuccessful electoral race.

This news story was published by La Repubblica during the pre-campaign
period. The clash between Di Maio and Renzi is represented by showing the
Facebook posts by which they have communicated their positions, using
a communicative style typical of the contemporary disintermediation and
mediatization of politics. However, their intents and results are different: while
Renzi has to defend himself from delegitimation, Di Maio declared his intent
of withdrawal. So the first one acted passively, answering to the Five Stars
Movement candidate who actively took a stand. Thus, Di Maio demonstrated
again, in this news story, his power in leading the agenda and campaign’s crucial
events, while Renzi appeared unable to answer to his attacks in a convincing
way. The Democratic Party candidate is not the main character in this story,
which is, once again, Di Maio, who referring to the electoral results obtained in
the Sicily regional elections declares the “political death” of the PD.

The article tries to defend Renzi from his delegitimation in several ways, first of
all by defining him, in the headline, as the “secretary of the Democratic Party”,
then quoting politicians, close to him, who criticized Di Maio, trying to make
him appear ridiculous, unprofessional and unprepared. Indeed, the article
recalls other episodes where the M5S candidate decided to not participate in
a TV debate, embedding two videos about the announcements made by the
TV presenter about Di Maio’s absence. Moreover, one of those videos is related
to a tweet made by a PD supporter who commented: “Michele Santoro19, Di
19      Michele Santoro is a prominent italian journalist, which has been Berlusconi’s main
opponent on the public tv network Rai2 during Berlusconi’s government, who has also been
dismissed by the network in 2002 because of his work and political orientation.

Maio is not coming to your TV show because he’s afraid that a journalist would
ask him some serious questions”. The theme of competence – which is, as we
have already seen, one central theme in the critics moved to the Five Stars
Movement by their opponents – is also adopted by Renzi, since he listed several
relevant policy issues he would have liked to discuss with Di Maio. This was an
attempt to be perceived as consistent, but Di Maio had a better lever: the very
good results M5S obtained in the Sicily regional elections.

In an attempt of legitimate his leadership, Renzi also references the vast
participation and transparency of the democratic primary elections for the PD
secretary, in order to discredit the Five Stars Movement internal voting processes
and software which is based an online platform where the Five Stars Movement’s
electors can log in and vote for their candidates or for other issues. Using this
quote the journalists gives resonance to the rhetoric clash “us vs. them”, where
the Democratic Party is described as transparent and involved in the public
interest, while the Five Stars Movement as not transparent and related to private
interests, that is, those of the company which has the economics rights on the
voting software. However, transparency and honesty are two main themes of
M5S political narrative, on which they have built their communication strategy:
since they have already colonized those concepts, using them against Di Maio
may prove not effective enough.

This particular news story also carry the potential to show a broader trend. As
we pointed out in the analysis of the headline and the article, the story show
a clear political leaning toward the Democratic Party and specifically Matteo
Renzi. La Repubblica itself is, in fact, often alleged to be leaning for PD. While
not reaching the threshold, the MP-MPAS score obtained by the Democratic
Party for La Repubblica is in fact the highest (see Figure 15). A look at the
structure of the social media interactions around the “canceled TV debate” case
helps to exemplify the drivers behind the attention dynamics of partisan online
audiences.

Ones again we observe an article with positive coverage of an opponent of the
Five Stars Movement receiving an unusual percentage of comments (49% vs
the 31% of Renzi’s category and overall more comments than reactions - 41%).
Nevertheless, ones we compare this case with the case of InformazioneVera
discussed above we clearly see two different versions of the same strategy at
stake. On the one hand, a negative content published by an opponent (Vittorio
Sgarbi) on his Facebook page is embedded with a title that reframes its original
meaning and re-shared by a news source close to the Movement that is therefore
getting attention and traffic. On the other hand, an article carrying a negative
coverage published by a news outlet considered hostile is commented and
thus this source gets the attention. The different paths and ultimate beneficiary
of the traffic generated by partisan communities explain the reasons why the

attention toward certain news source like La Repubblica is heterogeneous and
pinpoint the role played by (and potential economic motivations of) hyperpartisan news-outlets such as InformazioneVera.

Matteo Salvini and the racist raid in Macerata
The title of the most engaging news story related to the candidate Matteo
Salvini is: “Macerata: who is Luca Traini, the 28 years old man who shot to
African migrants. Northern League candidate in 2017”. It is an article about the
racist shooting against African migrants by a far-right extremist, Luca Traini,
happened in Macerata on February 3, 2018 – a month before the election day.

The article is representative of Matteo Salvini electoral campaign mainly
because it is centred on migration policies, ideological closure and nationalistic
values, which are some of the main traits that characterize Salvini’s campaign.
His harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric is also the reasons why many intellectuals,
journalists and political opponents has deemed him morally responsible for
the violent action executed by Luca Traini.

The article has been published online, on the same day of the shooting,
by “Il Fatto Quotidiano” and outlines a personal profile of the shooter, thus
immediately satisfying the natural curiosity of the readers. In the headline, the
journalist presents a connection between the League of Matteo Salvini and his
immigration policies: a successful journalistic strategy, since this is one of the
main frame that characterized all the debate about the episode. The article also
reports the rumor (that turned out to be false) about Traini’s relationship with
Pamela Mastropietro, a girl who has been killed and whose corpse has been
dismembered allegedly by a group of Nigerian immigrants few days before in
the same city where Traini performed his raid. According to a representative of
the regional League, quoted in the article, this relationship could be the real
reason for the racist raid: private revenge, thus, rather than ideology20. Another
frame presented in the articles points to the possible mental illness of the man.
This idea is introduced by an interviewed close to Traini that tried to humanize
and “justify” his violent and racist behaviour, relieving Traini from his complete
responsibility by constructing around him a rhetoric of the mentally ill man
who has had a difficult life. However, for the same reason, the readers can also
believe that he could be, as the interviewee said, “corrupted by wrong ideas”.


20       Few days after the publication of this article, the press reported a statement by
Traini himself to police that clarify the motivation behind the shooting made: “I wanted to
revenge Pamela and do something against immigration, because the phenomenon of illegal
immigration should be suppressed”.

While at a first glance this piece appears as a portrait of the shooter, it also carry
a precise narrative that attempts to understate the issue of immigration while
at the same time underlines the association of the shooter with the League
and its leader Matteo Salvini. Indeed, in the article the League is represented
negatively in two different ways: as the moral instigator who takes advantages
of the fragility of certain individuals to corrupt them with “wrong ideas”, and as
a factious and unreliable political force, ready to say anything (back the rumor
of the love relationship with the victim) in order to “wash its hands” of the
responsibility for the event. During the same hours, as pointed out by the online
traces left on 4chan and 8chan /pol/ boards, far-right online extremists were at
work to push an alternative narrative depicting Traini as an anti-migrant hero21.

The news stories about Salvini reached, in general, an higher rate of reactions
(65%) compared to shares (9%) and comments (26%). However, in the case
of this article, though the highest rate is always reached by reactions (50%)
and shares represents the lowest percentage (9%), we can see an increase in
comments rate (41%). Despite the highly controversiality of the topic, the share
of comments on this news story is lower than what we observed for Renzi and
Di Maio cases. Il Fatto Quotidiano, a relatively new but successful news outlet,
is often considered to be leaning to the Five Stars Movement.

Appendix 1: Methods
The analysis presented in this report are based upon a set of different
methodological approaches applied to multiple sources of data.


News Stories and Media Sources
The project aimed at creating a comprehensive map of the political news
coverage created by the Italian traditional and alternative online news media
in the lead up of 2018 general election
With this aim in mind, we designed, prototyped and deployed a technological
infrastructure aimed at collecting, in real time, a comprehensive dataset of
news stories around Italian politics published between 1st of September 2017
and 4th of March 2018.

The backbone of the infrastructure is based on an open source software called
Huginn. Similarly to the now discontinued Yahoo!Pipes, Huginn22 is a general
purpose system for building agents that perform automated tasks online. In
the scenario designed for this project, a set of agents periodically collects the
news stories, measure their social media engagement and interact with the
database to store this data.

The news stories are collected from three sources: Google News, the Global
Database of Society (GDELT)23 and Twitter. A set of agents periodically query
Google News RSS feed for news-stories related to Italian politics24, post a
request to GDELT API for the latest political news-stories published by Italian
news sources located in Italy25 and consume Twitter streaming API filtered for
tweets including a link and mentioning a candidate or a political party (see
note 5). Another agent is in charge of deduplicating the list of collected URLs
and filtering out news in languages other than Italian (via Google Language
API).

The final dataset consists of 84,815 URLs (news stories) from 4,113 unique
domains (media sources).


22     https://github.com/huginn/huginn.
23     https://www.gdeltproject.org/.
24     We specifically used the following Google News topics: Centro-sinistra in Italia, Centrodestra in Italia, Unione di Centro, Insieme, +Europa, Emma Bonino, Angelino Alfano, Giuliano
Pisapia, Campo Progressista, Matteo Salvini, Silvio Berlusconi, Luigi di Maio, Matteo Renzi, Forza
Nuova, Paolo Gentiloni, Articolo 1 – Movimento democratico e progressista, Liberi e Uguali,
Pietro Grasso, Fratelli d’Italia, Forza Italia, Lega Nord, Partito Democratico e Movimento 5 Stelle.
25     GDELT automatically categorize news stories. We specifically query stories for the
following categories: LEGISLATION, LEADER, GENERAL_GOVERNMENT and USPEC_POLITICS_
GENERAL1.

Facebook Data
The list of URLs resulting from the collection was then matched with the
Facebook Open Graph object that is canonically associated with an external
URL (og_object). Using this unique identifier, we also collected the news story
title, description, type (article, video, website, etc) and datetime of publication.

The list of og_object was also used to query, via a dedicated Huginn agent, the
Facebook Graph API URL endpoint to periodically collect the global number
of Facebook comments, reactions (a metric that includes likes and all the new
reactions) and shares. More specifically, the social media lifecycle of a newsstory was followed every two hours for an entire week (starting from the date
and time the story was published).
On average, the volume of Facebook interactions around a URL was observed
80.23 times per news story for a grand total of 4,906,999 observations.

Twitter Data
Beside the dataset of news stories with respective Facebook engagement,
we also collected and analyzed two additional Twitter datasets. Using Twitter
Enterprise search API via DiscoverText, we collected the retweets of Italian
politicians and political parties26 during January 2018. Using DMI-TCAT we
also followed the Twitter timelines of the top 5,000 contributors in the retweet
dataset and collected tweets published by this users between February 1 and
the March 4, 2018. We extracted and resolved the nearly 1.3 hundred million
URLs that were shared by these tweets to estimate the network structure of
the different media sources and measure the attention devoted to different
sources by partisan Twitter users.

These two datasets respectively consisted of 216,765 and 4,385,877 tweets.

Multi Party Media Partisanship Attention Score
Building upon the Media Partisanship Attention Scores (MPAS) developed by
Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, Hal Roberts, and Ethan Zuckerman for their study
on media landscape during the US Presidential Election, we relayed on Twitter
data to characterize the political leaning of a news source. The partisanship
scores served an important role in their analysis allowing the authors to identify
and describe patterns of attention among supporters of the major party
candidates for different media sources.

26     We specifically collected tweets that matched a “retweets_of:” rule for the following
Twitter accounts: luigidimaio, matteorenzi, matteosalvinimi, forza_italia, giorgiameloni,
giulianopisapia, angealfa, berlusconi, pbersani, articolounomdp, pdnetwork, leganordpadania,
beppe_grillo, mov5stelle, fratelliditaiia, campoprog, si_sinistra, alternativa_pop, nfratoianni,
possibileit, civati, noiconsalvini, maurizioacerbo, direzioneprc, pietrograsso, robersperanza,
lauraboldrini, paologentiloni, emmabonino, radicali, liberi_uguali, verditalia, insieme2018,
partsocialista, piu_europa, potere_alpopolo, LegaSalvini, bealorenzin, civica_popolare.

Designed for the US bipolar political context, the original score metric is
based on the frequency of sharing media sources among users who retweeted
messages from either of the two general election candidates (@realdonadtrump
and @hillaryclinton). The general idea is to categorize users first (based on the
proportion of their retweets) and then in turn categorize the news source they
shared. Mapping the two candidates on the left-to-right ideological scale, the
original MPAS metric, expressed on a -1.0 to 1.0 scale, allowed the authors to
categorize the news source in five categories (left, centre-left, centre, centreright and right).
In order to adapt this method to the multi-party Italian context we developed
a variation of this score named Multi Party Media Partisanship Attention Score
(MP-MPAS). Our adaptation is based on the frequency of sharing media sources
among users who retweeted messages from at least one of the account listed
in Table 7 aggregated per party and the tweets created by the top 5,000
contributors in the retweet dataset.

                                   with respective party and coalition associations

The underlying data extracted for this purpose included 3,950 users and
3,500,575 of their tweets with links, wich cited 19,274 unique domains27.

We then used the proportion of retweets associated with each party for each
media source as a measure of the party-centric partisanship. We thus obtained
a metric expressed on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale for each media source and party. A
media source that was included only in the tweets of users that retweeted the
accounts associated with the Five Stars Movement, received a score of one for
that party. On the other hand, a media source that was never mentioned in
the tweets of users that retweeted the accounts associated with the Five Stars
Movement, received a score of 0 for that party.

We thus ended up with a set of ten scores28 for each media source. Using these
scores, we proceeded to adjudicate the media source to the party with the

highests score if this score exceeded the threshold of 0.33. Media sources with
a maximum score of less than 0.33 were intead added to the “Cross-partisan”
category. In other terms, when a media source is adjudicated to a party, it
means that the source received an attention that was significantly partisan
(mainly concentrated among users who retweeted that party). On the other
hand, a media source was attributed to the “Cross-partisan” category when it
was shared by an etheorgenous audience.

Unlike our American colleagues, we were unable to use the Media Partisanship
Attention Score to create a continuous measure of party-centric partisan
attention to be mapped on a left-to-right ideological scale due to the presence
in the Italian context of the Five Stars Movement. Both M5S leaders and a
large share of their voters openly reject the idea to position the Movement on
this ideological scale29. Furthermore, M5S electoral program includes both a
proposal for a universal basic income, a tax cut and public debt reduction30.

Twitter users with the media sources they have retweeted. This bi-partite
network was then projected into a weighted undirected network, connecting
media sources that have been shared by the same users and with the weight
of the connection representing the number of users who shared both sources.
The initial bipartite network contained 4,458 nodes (3,740 users and 628 media
sources) and 103,029 edges. This projected into a network of media-media
connections counting 628 nodes and 154,368 edges.This projected network is,
as expected, extremely densely connected (graph density: 0.78).

The overall volume of Facebook interactions per day was used in connection to
text mining and cluster analysis to identify the most salient news topics in the
months leading to the election day and the most talked about topics related to
one of the fours main political leaders.

To describe the long road to the elections day, we identified the ten days with
greater Facebook engagement both in the pre-electoral campaign period (from
September 1, 2017 until January 31, 2018) and in the electoral campaign period
(from February 1, 2017 until March 4, 2018). We ordered the news stories of
each day by their engagement and then we selected all the news stories until
we reached a cumulative frequency of 75% of the total engagement of the
day. According to this method we have extracted 405 news stories in the preelectoral campaign period, and 384 in the electoral campaign period. We then
classified the news titles and descriptions of these news stories according to
the categories of “political issues”, “policy issues”, “campaign issues”, “personal
issues”. We borrowed our issue classification from Patterson (1980)31. Despite
some problems in the definition of the semantic borders between these
categories, this analytical tool proved to be adequate to monitor Italian electoral
campaign since 1983 (Grossi, Mancini, Mazzoleni 1985; Marini, Roncarolo 1997;
Iannelli, Giglietto 2015)32. We defined as “political issues” those issues concerning
the dynamics of the political system, the relations between its key players, and
the more abstract spheres of the political competitions. We considered as
“policy issues” those issues related to the concrete problems that affect citizens
closely and that the political system may face through specific interventions/
solutions. We classified as “personal issues” those issues concerning the leaders/
candidates’ private life and their extra-political activities. Lastly, we labelled
“campaign issues” those issues related to the strategic and organizational
aspect of the electoral campaign. Within these macro categories, leveraging
on previous research on the Italian General elections and considering what

emerged from our data, we identified diverse micro issues.

As regards “political issues”, we identified the following micro issues: institutional
candidacies/government formulas, ideological visions between fascism and
anti-fascism, alliances/coalitions/governability, intra-coalition problems, legal
issues/corruption/legislative actions against corruption, renewals of parties and
their political actors, problems between politicians and journalists, and other.

With respect to “policy issues”, we identified the following micro-issues: laws/
reforms related to political class’s privileges, immigration, economics/fiscal
policy, interventions for the victims of earthquakes, civil rights, school/university,
local administration, electoral reform, europe, health, pensions, labor, security,
pollution/environment, and other.

We declined “personal issues” in two micro issues, that is, the personal qualities/
competences/extra-political activities of the candidate/leader and the personal
insults/violences/aggressions between politicians.

As for “campaign issues”, we identified the following micro-issues: candidates’
choice/lists’ formation/assignment to the voting district, campaign activities/
management, polls/comments on the results of local elections, slogan/spot/
satire, campaign’s rules, and other.

Given the presence of news stories that reported accounts related to some of
these macro and micro issues or other topics without any reference to the Italian
political campaign or candidates/parties/coalitions/ideologies, we added the
category of “news report”. The micro-issues of “news reports” emerging from data
concerned: racists insults/crimes involving immigrants; statistics on immigration
and positive portraits of immigrants; female murders/bullying/vandals/gunfire/
crashes; statistics (national debt, employments, health, instruction, justifiable
homicide); foreign leader/policies; events involving professors and parents at
school; movies and TV programmes about cultural heritage, Mussolini, and
homosexuals; scientific events/pollution; layoffs/underpaid workers/insufficient
pensions; episodes of corruption/insolvency involving businessmen; terrorist
attacks in other countries; and other.

To identify the top topics related to each of the main candidates, we started by
splitting our dataset of news stories in four subsets of news stories related to
each one of them, and performing a set of text pre-processing steps necessary
for an effective cluster analysis. Using the “quanteda” package (R), we identified
and merge proper names (names and surnames) and compounded names of
political parties by identifying capitalized terms and performing a “collocations”
analysis - that is, the analysis of the sequences of words or terms that co-occur
more often than would be expected by chance. Then, using R functions we

converted words to lowercase, removed punctuation and numbers, and filtered
out the most common italian grammatical words (“stop-words”) which have not
enough semantical value in the documents and discriminating power between
the documents, using the stopwords list provided by the “tm” package. We
also removed “noise” in documents using, again, the analysis of collocations to
identify patterns of words without semantic values related to the news stories
content, that could have disturbed the cluster analysis, removing them. Lastly,
using the text mining “quanteda” package, we performed a “stemming” process
to remove derivational affixes and aggregate similar terms written in different
forms, and transformed the cleaned dataset of texts in a document-term
matrix, where rows correspond to the news stories and columns to their terms,
using “term frequency-inverse document frequency” statistics as weighting
factor. After removing all the terms not occurring in at least two documents,
we computed a distance matrix based on cosine similarity using the “proxy”
package, and finally we performed a cluster analysis on the news stories using
the K-Means algorithm on that matrix, using “factoextra” package.

We extracted ten clusters in each months for each candidate. Among them,
we selected the clusters with a greater quality using the “silhouette” method,
extracting all the clusters with an average silhouette width greater that the
global average silhouette width. Lastly, we selected the top ten most significant
clusters of news stories of each candidate using a double relevance criteria: one
related to their relevance for the media, the other related to their relevance for
the social media audience, by considering the number of news included in the
cluster and the engagement they reached on Facebook.

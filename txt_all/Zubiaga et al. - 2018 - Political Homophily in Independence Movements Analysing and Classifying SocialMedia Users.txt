                                              classification of social media users as supporting or opposing ongoing independence movements in their territories. Independence

                                              methodology that relies on users’ self-reported location to build large-scale datasets for three territories – Catalonia, the Basque
                                              Country and Scotland. An analysis of these datasets shows that homophily plays an important role in determining who people connect
                                              with, as users predominantly choose to follow and interact with others from the same national identity. We show that a classifier relying
                                              on users’ follow networks can achieve accurate, language-independent classification performances ranging from 85% to 97% for the

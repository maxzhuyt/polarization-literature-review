                  ABSTRACT Public perception about the reality of climate change has remained polarized
                  and propagation of fake information on social media can be a potential cause. Homophily in

                  understood to lead to the formation of echo chambers which reinforce individual beliefs and
                  fuel further increase in polarization. Quite surprisingly, in an empirical analysis of the effect of
                  homophily in communication on the level of polarization using evidence from Twitter conversations on the climate change topic during 2007–2017, we ﬁnd that evolution of homophily over time negatively affects the evolution of polarization in the long run. Among various
                  information about climate change to which people are exposed to, they are more likely to be
                  inﬂuenced by information that have higher credibility. Therefore, we study a model of
                  polarization of beliefs in social networks that accounts for credibility of propagating information in addition to homophily in communication. We ﬁnd that polarization can not increase
                  with increase in homophily in communication unless information propagating fake beliefs has
                  minimal credibility. We therefore infer from the empirical results that anti-climate change
                  tweets are largely not credible.

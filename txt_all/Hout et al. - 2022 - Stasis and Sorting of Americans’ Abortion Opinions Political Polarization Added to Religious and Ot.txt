Note: Marginal differences statistically control for all other factors in the model. The liberal-conservative difference was bigger for women than men
because of a statistically significant interaction between ideology and gender. The difference between people with no religion and Evangelicals or Catholics
was bigger for weekly attenders than those who never attend because of a statistically significant interaction between attendance and denomination. The
difference between full-time workers and homemakers is shown for women only because the difference was never significant for men.

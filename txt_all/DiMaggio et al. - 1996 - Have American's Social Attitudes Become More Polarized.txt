      Many observershave assertedwithlittleevidencethatAmericans'
      social opinionshave becomepolarized.UsingGeneralSocial Survey
      and National ElectionSurveysocial attitudeitemsthathave been
      repeatedregularlyover 20 years,the authorsask (1) Have Americans' opinionsbecome moredispersed(highervariance)?(2) Have
      distributions become flatteror more bimodal (decliningkurtosis)?
      (3) Have opinionsbecomemoreideologicallyconstrainedwithinand
      acrossopiniondomains?(4) Have pairedsocial groupsbecomemore
      differentin theiropinions?The authorsfindlittleevidenceofpolarization over the past two decades, with attitudestowardabortion

 These views are echoedbymuchofthegeneralpublic:in June1995,86%
 agreedthat"therewas a timewhen people in thiscountryfelttheyhad
morein commonand sharedmorevalues thanAmericansdo today."2
   Yet despite widespreadclaims and perceptions,littlesystematicresearch bears on ideologicalpolarizationper se. The impressivebody of
recentscholarshipon aggregateopinionchange(Page and Shapiro 1982,
 1992; Chafetzand Ebaugh 1983; Smith 1990b; Davis 1992; Hochschild
 1995;butsee Yang and Demerath1996)has focusedon centraltendencies,
addressingpolarizationonlyin the importantbut limitedsense of differences betweenparticularsocial groups.
   Opinionpolarizationis interesting  because of its potentialcausal relationshipto such phenomenaas politicalconflictand social volatility.But
too oftenthepresenceofpolarizationis inferred   fromthepoliticalconflict
or volatilityitis presumedto cause. Notingincreasedpartisanshipin Congressin summer1995,retiredSenatorWarrenRudman(R-N.H.) worried:
"We may be seeingin Congressa microcosmof what's happeningout in
the country... What we are seeing is a polarizationout therein the
country,and what is happeningin Congressis a reflection     of that."3
   To assume,as SenatorRudman did, thatthe politicalsurfacereflects
a deepercollectiveconditionis natural,reasonable-and potentially     misleading.We shall ask if SenatorRudman,and the manyotherswho believe the Americanpublic has become more polarized,are right.To do
so, we analyze20 yearsofdata fromtheGeneralSocial Survey(GSS) and
National ElectionStudy(NES) to see ifAmericans'opinionson domestic
social issues have indeed become more polarizedin recentdecades and
to identify theextent,nature,and locus of such polarizationas mayhave
occurred.
   This articlehas a second purpose:The empiricalpuzzle providesan
occasion to reopena neglectedtopic-polarization (and, more broadly,
distributionalpropertiesof public opinion)-the significanceof which
transcendscontemporary    politicaldebate.We developa multidimensional
definition of attitudepolarizationand suggestthatresearchon distributionalproperties  ofpublicopinionmayilluminatesignificant    issuesin the

 social effects
              is familiarto sociologists.Simmel([1908]1955,p. 15) argued
 thatthedegreeofconsensusand disagreement       is a fundamental  property
 ofhumangroups:social units,he wrote,"needsome quantitativeratioof
 harmonyand disharmony"      in orderto persist(see also Coser 1956).Blau
 (1977) formalizedSimmel'sinsightsin pioneeringworkon theanalysisof
 distributionsof social and demographicattributes.   Aside fromRossi and
 Berk(1985) and Granovetter   and Soong(1988),however,theimplications
 of Simmel'sideas forthestudyofpoliticalopinionshave notbeen developed.
   Similarly,publicopinionoriginally  was understoodas a collectiveproperty (Herbst 1993; Noelle-Neumann[1980] 1993), but contemporary
public-opinionresearcherstend to portrayit as the aggregateof individual attitudes.Notable exceptionsare Page and Shapiro(1982, 1992),
who explorethe paradoxicalstabilityof aggregateopinioncomparedto
instabilityin individual opinions,and Noelle-Neumann(1993), whose
workon the"spiralofsilence"(thereticenceofpersonsto expresspolitical
opinionsto otherstheybelievedisagreewiththem,and thebiasingeffects
on politicaldebate ofsystematic   variationsin reticence)calls attentionto
the impact of distributional  factors,which receiveexplicitattentionin
effortsto formalizeNoelle-Neumann'sideas (Granovetterand Soong
1988; Huckfeldtand Sprague 1988; and Kuran 1995b).
   We believe thatdistributional   propertiesof public opinionmay have
importantconsequencesforpoliticalconflictand change.In the conclusion to this article,we speculatethat the degreeand natureof opinion
polarizationinteractwithinstitutional    factorsto conditionthe outcome
of two-party  competition as depictedin median-voter    theoriesand to influencethe likelihoodof preferencefalsification,   the shape of spiral-ofsilencedynamics,the extentof politicalvolatility,and the characterof
interest-group formation.


WHAT IS POLARIZATION?
Given polarization'sprominencein contemporary     politicaldiscourse,the
literatureprovidesstrikingly  littleguidancein definingit.4Perhaps the
best place to begin is with what polarizationis not. Polarizationis not

Studentsofeconomicinequalityhave done usefulwork(see,esp.,Estebanand Ray
[1994]on incomepolarization),

 tion reducibleto the balance of responsesbetweenagreementand disagreementwith surveyitems (exceptin the limitingcase of two-point
 scales). It is in the extremity of and distancebetweenresponses,not in
 theirsubstantivecontent,thatpolarizationinheres.5
   Polarizationis botha stateand a process.Polarizationas a staterefers
 to theextentto whichopinionson an issueare opposedin relationto some
 theoreticalmaximum.Polarizationas a processrefersto the increasein
 such oppositionover time.We focus here on polarizationin the latter
 sense.
   To analyze change in the degreeof polarization,we must be able to
 measureit. In orderto measureit, we mustbe able to defineit. And to
 definepolarization,we mustbe clear about whywe are interestedin it.
 Our premiseis that,otherthingsbeingequal, attitudepolarizationmilitates againstsocial and politicalstabilityby reducingthe probabilityof
 groupformation     at thecenteroftheopiniondistribution and byincreasing
 the likelihoodof the formationof groupswithdistinctive,     irreconcilable
 policypreferences.
   Given that premise,we need a theoryof, or at least some intuitions
 about, opinionaggregationas a foundationformeasurement.We have
 foursuch intuitions.(They are testablein principle,but it is beyondthe
 scope of thisarticleto do so.)
   Two of theseintuitionsreferto propertiesof singledistributions:
   1. Otherthingsbeingequal, the moredispersedopinionbecomes,the
moredifficult    it will be forthepoliticalsystemto establishand maintain
centristpoliticalconsensus(thedispersionprinciple).
   2. Otherthingsbeingequal, the greaterthe extentto whichopinions
move toward separate modes (and the more separate those modes become),the morelikelyit is thatsocial conflictwill ensue (thebimodality
principle;see Esteban and Ray 1994).
   Two otherintuitionsreferto relationships     amongdistributions:
   3. Otherthingsbeingequal, themorecloselyassociateddifferent      social
attitudesbecome (both withinand across opiniondomains),the greater
the likelihoodof implacable conflict(the constraintprinciple;see Converse 1964).
   4. Otherthingsbeingequal, thegreatertheextentto whichsocial attitudesbecomecorrelatedwithsalientindividualcharacteristics       or identities,the morelikelyit is thattheywill becomethe fociof social conflict
(the consolidationprinciple;see Blau 1977).
   Thus polarizationis multidimensional     in character.Each of our four

principlessuggestsa distinctdimension,and a distinctmeasure,of polarization.
  Dispersion.-Public opinionon an issue can be characterizedas polarized to the extentthat opinionsare diverse,"farapart" in content,and
relativelybalanced betweenends of the opinionspectrum.The natural
measureof opinionspreadis thevariance,withpolarizationentailingincreasedvarianceover time.The variancerepresents   the extentto which
any two randomlyselectedrespondentsare likelyto differin theiropinions; it is also affectedby the proportionof extremeresponses.When
opinion becomes more polarized,variance increases.The formulafor
varianceis
                           2     (   -)N     -
                                                 1,

   Bimodality.-Public opinionis also polarizedinsofaras people with
different positionson an issue clusterintoseparatecamps,withlocations
betweenthetwo modal positionssparselyoccupied.Note thatbimodality
              distinctfromthedistancebetweenpositions.Because actors

whichopinionvariationleads to conflictis likelyto dependon theextent
to whichoccupantsofpolarstancesare isolatedfromone another.(Polarizationcould,ofcourse,manifestitselfin clustering   aroundthreeor more
modes.Althoughthispossibilityis oftheoreticalinterest,    thisformofpolarizationappears neitherin our data nor in the contemporary     rhetoric
of polarization,and thusis beyondthe scope of thisdiscussion.)
   If variancerepresents the spread of opinion,kurtosisservesto tap bimodality(Walterand Lev 1969,chap. 4; Chissom1970;Darlington1970;
Smith1991).Kurtosisis ordinarilyused diagnostically,    but herewe focus
on its substantiveimplications.If a distribution  is peaked (indicatinga
highlevelofconsensus),kurtosisis positive.If it is flatter
                                                         thanthenormal
distribution,kurtosisis negative;as it reachesbimodality,kurtosisapproaches-2. The formulaforkurtosis(k) is

                   k = {[X(X - m)4 . N]ls4}-3,

wherem is themean,s thestandarddeviation,and subtracting    "3" ensures
thatthe normaldistribution  takes the value "0."
  Because kurtosismaybe unfamiliarto somereaders,we provideexamples of differentkindsof distributionsin figure1. The top row of figure
1 demonstrates  theindependenceof kurtosisfromskewness.If responses
are concentrated, indicatingopinionconsensus,kurtosiswill be positive
whetheror not attitudespeak at the centerof the distribution  or at one
of the poles. The nextfourpanels of figure1 demonstratethat kurtosis

    The finaltwopanelsillustratethedifference   betweenkurtosisand variance. Dispersionand bimodalityare analyticallyand empirically     distinct:
 one mayfindmuchbimodalitywithina relatively       narrowrangeofopinion
 or a flatdistributionofpersonsacrossa verywide rangeofopinion.(Dispersionand bimodalityare mostinterdependent      at extremeconsensus,as
 varianceapproacheszeroand kurtosisapproachesinfinity.)       The finaltwo
 panels depictsharplybimodaldistributions,     but themodesof thesecond
 panel are fartherapart than are thoseof the first.This largergap is reflectedin thehighervarianceofthesecondpanel,whereastheequivalent
 degreesof bimodalityare reflected   in equal kurtosisin the two panels.
   The value ofkurtosisas a measureofpolarizationcan be seen by comparingit to thealternatives.If one simplyadds theproportion    ofextreme
 responsesto a question,one cannotdistinguish   betweenbimodalpolarization and consensusaround a singlepole. Variance,as we have seen, is
a good measureof dispersion,but it providesless information        about a
distribution's shape. Skewnessreflects   the directionin whicha distributionis biased fromnormality   butis insensitiveto differences betweennormal and polarizeddistributions   withmeansat theircenter.Onlykurtosis
is sensitiveto the proportionof extremeresponsesand capable of distinguishingbetweena sharpskew to eitherside on theone hand and movementof responsesfromthecenterto bothends ofthedistribution          on the
other.A disadvantageof kurtosis-its sensitivity      to scale effects,especiallythelengthof a distribution's  tails-does notaffectthe analysesreportedherebecausewe compareonlyscalesand itemswithconstantnumbers of responsecategoriesover time.
   Constraint.-By opinionconstraint,we referto the extentto which
opinionson any one itemin an opiniondomain(a set of thematically        related issues) are associatedwithopinionson any other.FollowingConverse (1964), we view constraintas an indicatorof ideologicalcohesion
thatvariesin degreeand scope: politicalopinionsare coherentinsofaras
theyare mutuallyconstrained(e.g.,knowingmyopinionaboutpremarital
sex enablesyouto predictmyviewson abortion)and insofaras constraint
is extensivein scope (e.g.,knowingmyopinionabout premaritalsex also
helps you predictmy views on issues-like school prayer-not related
to sexual behavior).The mostextensiveideologiesprovideoverarching
narrativesthatlend coherenceto opinionson manylogicallydistinctissues. Because constraint and scope are analyticallyindependent,   we analyze constraintwithinparticularissue domainsand also across multiple
issue domains.
   Althoughconstraintmay seem peripheralto polarization,it is central

maximallydispersedand bimodal.But would such a conditioncapture
what we mean when we speak of politicalpolarization?We thinknot.
Politicsin such a world mightbe tiresomelydisputatious;but because
attitudeson different issueswould be uncorrelated, politicalorganization
aroundanythingbut narrow,special issue campaignswould be impossible. Gridlock,not civil strife,would result.
   Coleman (1957, p. 10) arguedthatcross-issuecontagionis part of the
naturalhistoryofpoliticalpolarization.Implicitin mostaccountsofpolarization and explicitin ones that employthe imageryof "culturewar"
(Hunter 1991; Guinness 1993) is the assertionthat formerly    unrelated
opinionsare now bound up in a narrative-a "crowningposture"(Converse 1964) or "masterframe"(Snow and Benford1992)-that much of
thepublicfindscompelling.Thus we view opinionconstraintas a necessarybut insufficient conditionfora sociologicallyinteresting         of

    Consolidation.-The public-opinion   literature
                                                 ordinarily viewsopinion
 polarizationas difference  in responseto attitudeitemsby membersof
 groupsdefinedon the basis of nominal(e.g.,gender,race,occupation)or
 graduated(e.g.,age,income,yearsofschooling)parameters(see,e.g.,Shapiroand Mahajan 1986;Page and Shapiro 1992,chap. 7; Brint1994,pp.
 110-21).The greaterthedifferences  acrossmultipleindicators,  thegreater
 the degreeof opinionpolarizationbetweentwo groups.
    Drawingon Blau (1977),we regardtheconsolidationof parametersas
 increasingthe likelyratioof within-group   to between-group   interaction
 (in proportionto the parameters'salience) and the likelihoodof group
 mobilization.We extendBlau's frameworkby treatingsocial attitudes,
 as wellas sociodemographic                 as parameters.The constraint
                             characteristics,
and consolidationprinciplesare formallysimilar:the formerrepresents
associationsamongopinions(i.e.,ideologicalpolarization),thelatter,consolidationofopinionparametersand structural     parameters(i.e.,identitybased polarization).
    Studiesof intergroup agreementand disagreement    typicallyuse one of
two measures:the difference    in means or the proportionof each group
respondingin a certainmanner(e.g.,agreeingsomewhator agreeingvery
much with a given position).Althougheithermeasureis adequate for
manypurposes,each suppressessomeinformation       relevanttounderstanding intergroup  differences.Focusingon the mean revealsnothingabout
the shape of the distribution. Focusingon the proportionat one end of
thescale withholdsinformation    about the patternof responsein therest
of the scale.
   We have argued that within-population     polarizationis a functionof
both dispersionand bimodality.Similarly,we contendthat betweenpopulation polarizationdepends on both the spread between sample
means and the peakednessof opinionwithineach sample.The intuition
behindthisassertionis thatpoliticalconflict  betweengroupsis a function
ofbothbetween-group    polarization,whichincreasesthelikelihoodofconflict,and within-group  polarization,whichreducesit (by makingit difficult foradvocates of any positionto claim to speak forthe groupas a
whole).Therefore,  we regardtwo groupsas polarizedin a mannerlikely
to lead to intergroupconflictonlyto the extentthat (a) between-group
differences are substantialand (b) within-group  polarizationis minimal.
   To capturebothfacetsof polarizationwe mustuse two measures.We
inspectdifference ofmeansovertimeto see ifbetween-group       differences
have becomegreateror smaller.But we add to thisan analysisofchange
over timein kurtosisforeach group.In some cases, takingaccount of

   Each of our fourprinciples,and themeasurethatderivesfromit,taps
a distinctdimensionofopinionpolarization.Polarizationcan be said withoutqualificationto increaseonlywhenopiniondistributions   becomemore
(1) dispersed,(2) flator bimodal, (3) closelyassociated,and (4) closely
linkedto salientsocial identities.Increaseson differentdimensionsindicate polarizationof differentkinds, with potentiallydifferentconsequences. Polarizationcan be said not to occur only absent increasesin
dispersion,bimodality,and consolidation(interitemconstraintbeing a
necessarybut insufficient condition).


DATA,MEASURES,AND ANALYTIC STRATEGY
To map change over timein Americans'attitudesrequireshigh-quality
nationalsample surveysthat ask the same questionson a regularbasis
and also collectdata on a wide rangeof backgroundvariables.We rely
on thetwoleadingsourcesofsuchitems,theGeneralSocial Survey(GSS)
and the National ElectionStudy(NES).
  The NES is a personal-interview   samplesurveyconductedby theUniversityof MichiganCenterforPoliticalStudiesin presidentialand midterm election years. The GSS is a regularlyadministered,personalinterviewsample surveyof U.S. householdsconductedby the National
Opinion Research Center(NORC) at the Universityof Chicago (Davis
and Smith1991, 1992).
  Because we are interested in attitudeconstraint,
                                                 as well as in thespread
and bimodalityof particularattitudes,we identify  severalissue domains
upon which to focus.Most assertionsthat opinionpolarizationhas increased referto social or culturalissues. Few observersdiscerngrowing
polarizationof opinionon economicor foreignpolicy.Therefore,we use
data on opinionsabout social issues(e.g.,abortion,race,genderroles,sexuality,and crime)over whichpolarizationis mostlikelyto be observed.
  The NES fieldslongersurveyswithmoreopinionitemsin presidential
electionyears.(Before1972,the NES was a much smallersurvey,with
few attitudequestions.)When we could, we used itemsrepeatedin offyear surveys.Otheritemswere asked onlyin presidentialelectionyears
from1972 to 1992. We used relevantGSS itemsforeach yeartheywere

   Cases coded"don'tknow"and "notapplicable"weretreatedas missing.
Althoughsome researchershave treated"don't know"responsesas centristormoderate,recodingthemat scale midpoints,   we rejectedthisoption
on the groundsthat lack of knowledge(or interest)does not moderate
views. (Conceivably,theignorantcan be inducedto take extremestands
on manyissues moreeasilythanthe well-informed.)
  If, however,we are wrong,and if "don't know" responseshave increasedmarkedlyoverthepast two decades,thisdecisioncould bias our
resultsin thisway: If "don't knows"have increasedin frequency-ineffectreflectinga migrationofpersonswithmoderateviewsfrommoderate
to "don't know" responsesand thus out of our effectivesample-then
polarizationcould be overestimated. If "don't knows"have declined,this
could lead us to underestimatethedegreeofpolarizingchange.To guard
against this possibility,we examinedtime trendsin "don't know" responsesto the35 attitudesscales(orcomponentitemsofscales)used in the
analysesthatfollowbyregressing   theproportion  of"don'tknow"answers
againstsurveyyear.Of the35 coefficients   thisproceduregenerated,only
six were significantat P c .05 and, of these,fivewere positiveand only
one was negative.This meansthat,ifone acceptsthepremisethat"don't
know"respondents   have moderateviews,polarizationmightbe overestimated in a few cases. These teststhen increaseour confidencein our
findings(reportedbelow) of little evidence that polarizationhas occurred.10

fromsupportforan unlimitedrightto abortion(1 = neverbe forbidden)
to theview thatabortionshouldneverbe permitted        (withthevalue "4").13

was removed.
13The two middlecategories  of the abortionquestionwerealteredin 1980.Before
1980,the optionswereto permitan abortion"ifthe lifeor healthof themotheris
threatened"and to permitan abortion"ifthemotherwillfindit difficult   to care for

   GSS.-The GSS posed two challenges.First,the GSS adopted a split
ballotdesignbetween1988and 1993;therefore,     mostquestionsofinterest
were asked of onlysome respondentsin thoseyears.Thus we could not
scale some attractiveitemstogetherbecause theyappeared on different
ballots.14Second,manyrelevantGSS itemswere dichotomousand thus
ill-suitedto recordingchangesin polarization,exceptforbetween-group
differences. As shown in table 2, six simple additive scales were constructedthatcombineditemstappingattitudeson relatedissues.15        First,
views on abortionare tapped by an additivescale of seven items,each
specifying a conditionunderwhich"it shouldbe possiblefora pregnant
woman to obtain a legal abortion."Second, a racismscale is based on
answersto 12 questionstappingattitudestowardAfrican-Americans         (or,
for African-American    respondents,white Americans).16   The questions
asked about acceptanceofvaryingdegreesofracialintegration      in schools,
willingnessto vote forAfrican-American    (white)presidentialcandidates,
attitudestowardbusing,towardresidentialsegregation,    and towardantimiscegenationlaws and segregatedsocial clubs, and attributions      of responsibilityforAfrican-Americans'   economicdisadvantage.A thirdscale
sumsresponsesto threeitemsabout women'sparticipationin thepublic
sphere.A fourthis based on fouritems,with responsesrangingfrom
"strongly agree"to "strongly disagree"on a four-point scale, about women's familyrole. Fifth,a sexualityscale is based on threeitemseliciting
attitudestoward premaritalsex, extramaritalsex, and homosexuality,
withfour-point  scales rangingfrom"alwayswrong"to "notwrongat all."
And, finally,a crime-and-justice  scale combinesresponsesto questions

Strategyof Exposition
Because we calculatedseveralmeasuresof polarizationusingdata on 13
scales representing severaldozen itemsover morethan 20 yearsforfull
samplesand severalsubsamples,we face a strikingdata-reduction    challenge.We relyon graphicmeans to reduce the welterof statisticsto a
formthatthe readercan grasp.
   We beginby askingifpolarizationhas increasedamongall Americans
withrespectto thefullrangeofsocial attitudesin bothsurveys.We illustrateresultsforeach opinionvariable withfourgraphs(see fig.2). The
horizontalaxis of each represents timeand rangesfrom1972 to 1994 for
all graphsforease of comparison.The resultsof plottingmeans across
time("Mean")replicateand extendin timefindings  reportedin otherstudies (e.g. Page and Shapiro 1992).We includethemfortheassistancethey
offerin interpreting morecentralresults.
  The crucialfindingsappear in the second,third,and fourthgraphsin
each row. The second reportsvariance(dispersion,y-axis)over time(xaxis). The thirdreportskurtosis(peakedness/bimodality) over time.The
fourth(formulti-item   scales only) reportschange over time in Chronbach's alpha (constraint).
                         Each graphincludespointobservations.a linear
regressionline of the y-axisagainstyear,and a smoothedloess (locally
weightedregression)  linedepictingchangein slope.'7Slopes and P-values

 fromlinearregressionsappear as texton each graph.'8(Because y-axis
 metricsare unstandardized,  slopes cannotbe comparedacrossitems,but
 theycan be comparedacrossgroupswithinitems.)We thenuse thesame
 procedureto reportresultsforspecificissuedomains:racialattitudes,attitudesaboutwomen'sroles,crime,abortionand sexualbehavior,and feelingstowardthepoor,liberals,and conservatives.    (All analysesentailcomparisonamongitemsorscales withconstantrangesovertime.One cannot
 comparevariance,kurtosis,or alpha acrossitemsof differing      range.)
   We nextexplorechangeover timein variance,kurtosis,and alpha on
thesame scales and itemsforseveralsubgroups-college graduates,voters,thepoliticallyactive,and people under30-to see ifpolarizationhas
occurredmore within"attentivepublics" (Arnold 1990) and the young
than withinthe populationat large.These analysesare reportedin the
mannerdescribedabove. In orderto conservespace,particularresultsare
presentedonlywhen (a) theydifferfromthoseforthesample as a whole
and (b) at least one measureof polarizationexhibitsa significant     time
trend.(A completeset of coefficients   is reportedin appendixtables Al
and A2 below.)
   Finally,we ask ifspecificpairs of groupshave becomemorepolarized
in relationto one anotherovertime(theconsolidationprinciple).Comparisonsare betweengroupsbased on age (youngerthan35 yearsold vs. older
than45 yearsold); gender(womenvs. men);race (African-Americans         vs.
whites);educationallevel (college graduatesvs. people with no formal
educationbeyondhighschool);faithtradition(religiousconservativesvs.
religiousliberals);ideology(conservativevs. liberal); region(South vs.
other);and partyaffiliation (Republicanvs. Democrat).'9For each comparisonwe presenttwo setsof linesin a singlepanel,thehorizontalaxis
of whichrepresents  time.The thickerset of lineswithineach panel plots

           Polarizationin the Populationas a Whole
Within-Group
To testtheproposition thatcontemporary                              by
                                         U.S. opinionis characterized
increasinginterdomain  constraintand polarization(Hunter1991;Bennett
1992; Guinness1993),we beginby analyzingomnibusscales,whichare
a combinationof all opinionscales and itemsdescribedin tables 1 and 2,
respectively.20Whethersocial conservatism  is a homogeneousideological
entityis of coursean empiricalmatter.Existingstudiessuggestthatconstraintis greateramongsocial attitudesthanbetweenthemand opinions
on economicor foreignpolicy,but reportthatsome social attitudes(e.g.,
towardcrimeand towardgender)have movedin different       directionsduring the years in question(Smith 1990b;Davis 1992; Page and Shapiro
1992). So theseanalysestestonlythe moststronglyframedassertionsof
growingpolarizationacross a unidimensionaldivide.
  Have public attitudeson a wide rangeof social issues scaled together
becomemorepolarized?Apparentlynot (see fig.2). A significant    decline
in variance on the GSS omnibusscale indicatesless polarization,while
NES scale variancewas stable.Kurtosis(bimodality)did not change,althoughNES data show a partialdepolarizingtrendreversedin themid1980s.Ideologicalconstraintis unchangedon bothscales.
  The omnibusscales are bluntmeasures.They effectively     demonstrate
the absence of polarizationon a wide socioculturalfront-an important
correctiveto therhetoricof"culturewar" and thedirewarningsofmany
politicalcommentators.  But perhapspolarizationhas occurredwith respectto a subsetof social and culturalissues.
  The readermayfindithelpfulto inspectthree-dimensional    graphicpresentationsof two scales thatillustrateverydifferentpatterns.In thefirst

   Figure 3 plots positions on the 16-point family-rolescale against the
percentage(0%-25 %) of respondents in each position and survey year
(1977-94). Relativelyhighpolarization(a gradualslope on theliberalside
and a long tail to the right)in 1977 shiftsto a morepeaked distribution
indicatingemergingliberalconsensusin 1994. During thisperiod,variance fellfrom6.88 to 6.12 and kurtosisrose(indicatingless polarization)
from-.32 to -.10. (Note thatthelowerthekurtosis,   thegreaterthepolarization:when opinionpolarizationdeclinzes,   kurtosisincreasesin magnitude.)2'

21It is possible,ofcourse,thatconcentration of opinionto theleftof thescale may
concealnew formsofopiniondiversity.   That is, opinioncan bunchup to theleftof
an existingscale eitherbecausemostpeoplegravitateto thesame pointor because
theunderlying  distributionmovesto theleft,placinglargenumbersofpeopleat positionsto theleftofthosethatcan be registered  bythemeasurement   instrument.This

  Figure4 illustrateschangeovertimein theGSS abortionscale. Americans were sharplydivided on abortionat the series' onsetin 1977,with
separatemodesat thefarleftand centerpointsofthescale. Opinionpolarized furtherafter1977, with variance increasingthroughoutthe period
(from5.19 to 5.96 in 1994) and bimodalitystartingat -1.08, peakiingat
-1.32 in 1984,and remainingstable thereafter.   We turnnow to results
forspecificissue domains(see figs.5-11).
  Race and poverty.-The GSS racial-attitudesscale demonstratesa
trendtowardlesspolarized(and moreliberal)racial attitudes,withvariance down and kurtosisup (fig.5). But, consistentwith past research
(Jackmanand Muha 1984; Schuman,Steeh,and Bobo 1985),broad endorsementof racial integrationdoes not implysupportforpoliciesthat
help minoritiesor sympathyforpoor people. Althoughvariance in response to the NES aid-to-minorities questiondeclinedthroughthe early
1980s,itincreasedafterthat(fig.6). Kurtosisbehavessimilarly,
                                                           rising(less
polarization)untilthe mid-1980s,thendeclining.Feelingstoward poor
people polarizedby bothmeasuresover thisperiod(fig.6). Thus, despite
emerging consensusfavoringracialintegration, viewsofthepoor,and,after
1984,ofgovernment   assistanceforminorities becamemorepolarized.

   Abortionand sexuality.-No issuerepresents      contemporary social conflictas vividlyas does abortion,thestruggleoverwhichhas becomesymbolic of the so-calledculturewars (Hunter1994). This reputationis deserved. Of all the measureswe analyzed,only the GSS abortionscale
evincespolarizationin all threesenses:increaseddispersion,bimodality
(thoughthis peaked in the mid-1980s),and (within-domain)       ideological
constraint (fig.9; see also Hout 1995).By contrast, we findno polarization
ofattitudeson sexual morality,   and a smallbut significantdeclinein constraint.
   Conclusion.-We find littlesupportfor the widely held belief that
Americanshave becomesharplypolarizedon a wide rangeof social and
culturalopinionsin the past two decades. Instead we finda varietyof
trendson specificissues. Americanshave become more unitedin their
views on women's rolein thepublic sphere,in theiracceptanceof racial
integration, and in theiropinionson mattersrelatedto crimeand justice.
These trendsrepresentmovementtowardconsensuson liberalviews on
racial integration  and genderand on tougherpositionson crime.By contrast,Americanshave become more divided in theirattitudestoward
abortionand,less dramatically,   in theirfeelingstowardthepoor.The fact
thatdivisionon theselatterissueshas increasedwithoutlargedirectional

 and A2.)
    Participantsin thepoliticalsystem.-The politicallyactiveare known
 to be unrepresentative     of the general population in numerousways
 (Verba,Schlozman,and Brady 1995),and it is possiblethat,as attentive
 observersof politicaldebates,theirviews have also becomemorepolarized. We focus here upon votersin the most recentelection(GSS and
 NES) and on peoplewho had scoresofthreeor moreon theNES activism
 scale. If politicalvolatilityreflectsopinionpolarization,such polarization
 shouldappear firstamongthe mostpoliticallyengaged.
    Votersdifferedfromthe public at large in onlytwo respects(fig.10).
 First,as forthe generalpublic,voters'GSS omnibusscales became less
 dispersed;but,unlikethepublicas a whole,theybecamemodestlyflatter.
 This resultdemonstrates     the utilityof viewingpolarizationmultidimensionally:variance in opiniondeclinedat the same timethat votersmigratedslightlyaway fromthe centerof a narrowingrange.Second,constrainton crimeand justice issues remainedunchangedamong voters,
 althoughit declinedforthe generalpublic (not shown).
   OnlytheNES includedmeasuresofpoliticalactivism,restricting       analyses to NES opinionitems(fig.11). Activistsexperiencedless polarization
thanthe generalpublic in theirattitudestowardpoor people (no significant change,althoughsignsof greaterbimodalityappear towardthe series' end; not shown). Only in theirfeelingstowardliberals(whichincreasedin varianceduringtheconservativemobilizationofthelate 1970s
and early1980s)did activistsdisplaymorepolarizationthanthe general
public.
   Collegegraduates.  -Many public-opinion     scholarsbelievethatbecause
well-educatedpeople attendto news media and value logicalconsistency
amongbeliefsmorehighly,theyexhibitgreaterideologicalconstraintin
responseto opinionsurveys(Converse1964).It followsthatcollegegraduates mayparticipatein politicaltrendssuch as polarizationmoreactively
thanless attentivepublics.Althoughthisview is controversial     (Juddand
Milburn1980;Kiecolt1988)and theviewsofwell-educatedpersonsgrew
moresimilarto thoseof otherAmericansby theearly1970s(Nie, Verba,
and Petrocik1976),we look at collegegraduatesseparatelyto ensuregiving polarizationa fairtest.
   Because theyare politicallyattentive,   collegegraduatesshouldbe especiallysubjectto polarization.One mightalso expectto findgreaterdispersionofopinionamongcollegegraduatesbecause,due to therapidexpansion of highereducation,thatgroupbecame composedof personsfrom
increasingly  diversebackgroundsthroughthe 1970s and 1980s.
   Resultsforcollegegraduatesare similarto thoseforthegeneralpublic,
AmericanJournalof Sociology

witha fewdifferences  (see fig.11).Unlikethegeneralpublic,collegegraduates displayno declinein variance on the GSS omnibusscale (in fact,
kurtosisdeclines)or in attitudestoward racial integrationor women's
familyroles;thereis also no increasein kurtosisforracial attitudes,nor
any declinein alphas forattitudestowardwomen's public roles.These
differencesreflectthe factthatthe generalpublic has gravitatedtoward
a liberalconsensuson racialintegration and genderthatcollegegraduates
had alreadyreachedat the onsetof the timeseries.By contrast,college
graduates'feelingstowardpoor people did notincreasein varianceover
the period,though,as forthe fullsample,kurtosisdeclined,indicating
movementtoward bimodality.(We were surprisedto findthat college
graduates'responsesto theNES abortionmeasurebecame less bimodal,
thoughno less dispersed.)24
   Youngpeople.-Perhaps a polarizingtrend,likean earliertrendtoward
liberalism(Davis 1992),may be foundin cohortsuccession,the forceof
whichis feltonlyas membersofyoungercohortsreplacetheirelders.To
testthispossibility,
                   we look foropinionpolarizationamongpeople who
werebetweentheages of 18 and 29 at thetimeofeach surveyadministration.The questionhereis whethertherehas been a trendtowardgreater
polarizationamongsuccessivecohortsofmenand womenenteringadulthood betweenthe early 1970s and the early 1990s.
  Differencesbetweenyoungpeopleand thegeneralpublicare numerous
but inconclusive(see fig.10). Responsesof men and womenunder30 do
not displaythe reducedvariancein the GSS omnibusscale foundin the
fullsample,buttheydo exhibitdecliningdispersionand constraint   in the
NES omnibusscale. Signs of polarizationvisiblein the generalpublic's
attitudestowardconservativesand towardthepoor,and increasedvariance and constrainton the GSS abortionscale, are absentfromdata on
youngerrespondents.  Otherindicators,however,pointto somewhatmore


24We also used theGSS data to look at changein thedistribution ofopinionamong
peoplewithhighoccupationalprestige(56 and greateron theDuncan scale) as an
additionaltest,withtheexpectation  thatexacerbated divisionsbetweenbusinesspersonsand professionals  on raceand genderissuesthatBrint(1994,pp. 119-21)found

betweenthe occupationally   prestigiousand the generalpublic.Unlikethe general

Americans,grew more negative)to the African-American      feelingthermometeramong youngpeople became moredispersed.Also in contrast
to the generalpublic,youngpeople displayedno declinein variancein
attitudestowardaid to minorities, no trendtowardpeakednessin racial
attitudes,and no significant declinein constraintin views on women's
public rolesand crime.
  Summary.   -Lacking evidenceofsubstantialpolarizationin thegeneral
public's social attitudesfromtheearly1970sto themiddle1990s,we analyzedseparatelydata fromvoters,politicalactivists,collegegraduatesand
youngpeople, to see if polarizationwas more markedamong attentive
publicsor theyoung.This exerciserevealedintriguing   patterns,butidentifiedno group that had experiencedsubstantiallygreaterpolarization
than the public at large.Overall,resultsreinforcethe conclusiondrawn
fromanalysesof the fullsample: increasedunitywithrespectto gender
roles,supportforracial integration, and the controland punishmentof
crime;polarizationwithrespectto abortionand,to a lesserextent,feelings
towardthe poor; and no systematicchangewithrespectto otherissues.


Polarizationas Between-GroupDifference
 Could it be that perceptionsof societalpolarizationreflecta deepening
 gulfbetweenone or morehighlyvisiblepairs of social groups?Does our
malaisereflect a situationin which"the social groupsintowhichthesocietyis dividingare less and less capable of understanding  and talkingto
one another" (Piore 1995,p. 8)? In thissectionwe explorechange over
timein opiniondissensusassociatedwithgender,race, age, educational
level,religion,self-definedpoliticalideology,partyaffiliation,
                                                            and region.
   For each pair of contrastinggroups,we plotthe mean value overtime
of each group's responseto each opinionscale or item.We thenregress
theabsolutevalue ofthedifference    in meansagainsttime(year)to establisha slope and testfortrends.We regarda positiveslope combinedwith
a coefficient foryear significantat P ' .10 as evidence of increasing
between-group   polarization.Figuresare presentedonlyforvariablesfor
which intergroupdifferences   displayeda significant trend(figs.12-19;
completeresultsare presentedin tabularformin appendixtablesA3 and
A4.)
   This comparisonis just one part of the story,however.Polarization
is of interestbecause of its potentialimpacton intergroupconflictand
opportunities forpoliticalmobilization.Thereforewe mustalso attendto
thedistribution ofopinionwithineach group.Even ifdifferences   between
two groupshave increased,the likelihoodthatsuch differences    will lead
to conflict,

 One partofthiscapacityis thedegreeof unitywithinthe group,as indicated by kurtosis.Effectiveintergrouppolarizationrepresentsboth a
 deepeningofdissensusbetweentwogroupsand a strengthening      ofconsensus withineach group.25
   Page and Shapiro(1992) documentthe phenomenonof "parallelpublics":subgroupopinionson mostissueschangein thesame directionover
timeas membersofeach groupassimilatethesame new information         and

variationin interestsor values) across changinglevels of mean response.
We shallask,first,ifsignificantchangein somebetween-group    differences

substantiveopinion.
   Age.-We comparedtheattitudesofmenand womenless than35 years
old to those of respondentsmore than 45 years old. This classification
permitstheonsetoftheseriesto capturethemostcelebratedgenerational
divide-the counterposition   of the 1960s generationand theirelderswhile the end of the seriesdistinguishesadequately betweenthe baby
boomers(and survivingpre-boomers)     and theirsuccessors.
   In the wake of the 1960s,some observersexpectedage to become a
definingaxis ofpoliticalconflictin postindustrial
                                                societies(see,e.g.,Gorz
1973,on youthas a class). But Davis's work (1992) reportsa declinein
the associationof youthwithliberalismin the 1980s (see also Page and
Shapiro 1992,p. 304), so we expectedto finddecliningage polarization,
and indeed we did (figs.12a-12b). Differencein means between age
groupsincreasedforno measuresand declinedsignificantly     for12 of 18.
(Therewas no declinein differences forthefeelingthermometers   forliberals and blacksor fortheNES omnibusscale,NES genderroles,and GSS
abortionand school prayermeasures.Of these,notable age differences
existedat the series' startonlyforNES genderroles.)

 educationaldividemightincreasingly   structure opinion.New-classtheory
 (Gouldner1979)viewedhighereducationas a majordeterminant        ofpolitical orientation.Collins(1979) arguedthatcollegegraduatesare an importantstatusgroup,possessingsharedinterests    and a commonculture.Evidence for education's increasingsalience can be foundin researchon
 maritalselection,whichfindseducationalhomogamyincreasingas other
 bases of spousal choicedecline(Kalmijn 1991).
   Surprisingly, then,significant trendstowardopinionconvergencebetweencollegegraduatesand peoplewithno morethana highschooleducationwere observedfornine of 18 measures,withdivergenceon none
 (figs.13a-13b). Betweenthe 1970sand theearly1990s,opinionsofcollege
 graduatesand the less schooledbecame moresimilarwithrespectto the
 GSS omnibusscale, feelingstowardconservatives,      and attitudestoward
 women'sroles(NES and GSS), abortion(GSS only),race,sex education,
 and legalrestrictionson divorce.Like the"generation  gap,"then,the"education gap" (at least in attitudestowardsocial issues) seems to have reflectedthe peculiar social and demographicconfiguration      of the 1970s
ratherthan an emergenttrend.
   Gender.-Political observershave noted a growing"gendergap" in
electoralbehaviorsince 1980.Do differences    in votingpatternsreflectdivergencein social attitudesas well? Previousresearchhas demonstrated
genderdifferences  in manyvalues and attitudes(Beuteland Marini 1995).
Shapiroand Mahajan (1986,p. 42), usingdata fromthe 1960sto themid1980s,reportgrowthin genderdifferences     in evaluationsof "policiesinvolvingtheuse offorce"and, to a lesserextent,in attitudestoward"regulation and public protection,mattersof compassion,and traditional
values."
   We findslim evidenceof a growinggendergap (fig.14). Men's and
women'sscoreson the NES omnibusscale divergesignificantly;        but the
actual increaseis tinyand theresultwas notrepeatedforany ofthescale
components.By contrast,we observedconvergence(largelycompleteby
1985)in opinionson crimeand justiceand sex education,and persistence
of moderate,stable genderdifferences   in othersocial attitudes.
   Race.-Racial divisionsin social attitudes,as in othermatters,are well
established.Hochschild(1995) and Page and Shapiro(1992,p. 298) documentstriking  differences,thoughthelatternotesomeconvergencein attitudes toward racial and moral issues in the 1980s. Extendinganalyses
throughthe mid-1990s,we finda notabledeclinein racial polarization,
withsignificant  convergenttrendsin feelingstowardliberals,conservatives,and thepoor;views on aid forminorities,   on crimeand justice,and
on abortion(GSS only);and scoreson theNES omnibusscale. On no scale
or itemdid black/whitedifferences   increase(fig.15a-15b).
   This convergenceis consistentwith Wilson's expectation(1978) that

  These findings are notableforthreereasons.First,theyprovidecircumstantialsupportforour contentionthat information    on intragroup polarizationis usefulin assessingthe politicalimplicationsof intergroup
differences in opinion:one can argue impressionistically that AfricanAmericanshave had more difficulty    mobilizingpoliticallyduringthe
                                                in thesedata. Second,
l990s, in partdue to theinternaldivisionreflected
thesefindingssuggestthatthe"parallelism"visiblein directionalopinion
changemay not always characterizechangein intragroupdistributions.
Third,theymake us morecautiousthanwe mightotherwisebe in interpretingpolarizationin thegeneralpopulation'sattitudestowardthepoor

 ofconflictoverracialintegration  (on whichopinionshave now converged)
 by a homologousdivisionof opinionover symbolicracial issues.
   Religion.-Few bases ofpoliticaloppositionhave receivedas muchrecentattentionas theclashbetweenthereligiousright-politicallyoriented
 evangelicalProtestants perceivedto be alliedon manyissueswithconservativeRoman Catholicsand OrthodoxJews-and thesecularand liberal
 religiousworlds(Evans 1996;Wuthnow1988).Althoughresearchon congregations(Ammerman1987)has demonstrated         muchattitudeheterogeneityamongconservativeProtestants,     it remainsto be seen whetherthe
politicalmobilizationofconservativefaithcommunities      has increasedpolarizationbetweentheirmembersand otherAmericans,as reflectedin
public opiniondata.
   We comparedmembersof conservativeProtestantdenominations           and
Roman Catholicswho reportedattendingservicesalmostweeklyor more
to membersofreligiously    liberalProtestantdenominations,  Jews,and the
religiouslyunaffiliated.27(Because NES did not collectdetaileddata on
religionuntil 1992, we used only GSS measures.)Remarkably,given a
frequentequation of conservativefaithcommunitieswith"the religious
right,"differences betweenreligiousconservativesand religiousliberals
declined duringthe 1970s and 1980s, with significantconvergenceon
sevenofnineattitudemeasures(figs.16a-16b). The groups'opinionsbecame more similarnot just on such issues as women's roles,on which
polarizationdeclinedmoregenerally,    but also on such"hot-button"  moral
issuesas abortion,sexual conduct,sex education,and legal restrictions  on
divorce.Only attitudestowardcrime,wherea tinydifference          vanished
by 1980, and school prayer,where a large difference      persisted,evaded
thistrend.(Convergencealso occurredon racialattitudes,    butas indicated
in n. 16 above, we cannotexcludethepossibilitythatthisfindingis artifactual.)
   The attitudesof religiousconservativesand liberalson women's roles
convergeddramatically.On mostotherissues,verylargedifferences         beConservativeProtestant   denominations wereidentified on the basis describedin
Smith(1990a);Catholicswereincludedbecauseofpreviousworkindicating         thatobservantCatholicsare similarto conservative Protestantsin theirsocialviews(Smith
1990a).BecausetheGSS didnotdistinguish   amongReform,    Conservative, and Orthodox Jewsbefore1988 and because the numberof OrthodoxJewsin GSS samples
thereafteris negligible,Jewishrespondents  are coded as "liberal"(again following
Smith1990a).We excludedmembers     ofwhatSmith(1990a)callsthe"Protestant    moderate"denominations   in orderto sharpenthecontrastbetweenthetwo groupsand
thusprovidethepolarization  hypothesiswitha fairertest.In initialanalyses,we comparedreligiousconservatives  to everyoneelse. Surprisedby theabsenceofevidence
ofpolarization, we thenconductedtheanalysesreported    here(comparing   themonly
to religiousliberalsand thenonreligious),
                                        butwe stillfoundno polarization.

To see ifthisis thecase,we comparerespondents who describethemselves
as "liberal"or to thosewho say theyare "conservative."
  Withone exception,we findno polarization(fig.18). Throughoutour

Summaryof Findings
1. We findno supportforthepropositionthattheUnitedStateshas experienceddramaticpolarizationin public opinionon social issuessincethe
1970s. Variance in most attitudeshas not increased;neitherhas bimodalityof response.Nor have mostattitudesgrownmoreconstrainedby
ideologyor (exceptforpartyaffiliation)groupidentity.
  2. If attitudepolarizationentailsincreasedvariance,increasedbimodality,and increasedopinionconstraint,thenonlyattitudestowardabortionhave becomemorepolarizedin thepast 20 years,bothin thepublic
at largeand withinmostsubgroups.Abortionattitudemeasuresbehave
                                                        Social Attitudes

 differentlythanmeasuresofopinionon any otherissue,underscoring       the
 exceptionalcharacteroftheabortiondebate.To generalizefromtheabortioncontroversy  to otherissues,or to view it as evidenceof moredeepseated polarization,is profoundly  misleading.
   3. Partialpolarization(in some measuresbut not others)has occurred
in a GSS omnibusscale (bimodality   onlyforvotersand collegegraduates);
in attitudestowardconservatives(bimodalityforthegeneralpublic,voters,collegegraduates,and politicalactivists)and liberals(dispersionfor
activists);and in feelingstowardthe poor (dispersionand bimodalityfor
the generalpublic and voters,increaseddispersionforpeople under30
and increased bimodalityfor college graduates) and toward AfricanAmericans(greaterdispersionfor people under 30). Despite an overwhelmingtrendtowardconvergence       in supportofracialintegration,these
resultsindicatesomepolarizationon issuesimbuedwithracialsymbolism
(see Jackman1994).
   4. Mostscalesand itemsdisplayno increasein anymeasureofpolarizationforanysubgroup.Americanshave becomemoreunifiedin theirattitudestowardracial integration,  crimeand justice,and, especially,women's roles.Dispersionand bimodalityin attitudestowardsexualityand
feelingstoward African-Americans     and liberals have remainedlargely
stable.
   5. Between-group             in social attitudeshave steadilydeclined.
                      differences
Althoughmanyremaingreatin absoluteterms,social-attitude         polarizationby age, education,race,religiousfaith,region,and (exceptforabortion)politicalideology,declinedbetweenthe 1970s and the 1990s. Only
the gap betweenRepublicansand Democratsgrew,suggestingthat the
partysystem,whichhas conventionally      been expectedto moderatesocial
divisions,has been exacerbatingthem.
   6. Polarizationis measurable,multidimensional,   and interesting.The
findingsthatthe public has polarizedaround the abortionissue and (to
a lesserextent)in its views of the poor,but has becomemoreunifiedin
supportforracialintegration,  therightsofwomento participatein public
life,and toughstandson crimeand justiceare intuitively    plausible.The
factthatmeasuresof spread,bimodality,and constraintdo not move in
tandem(and in some cases move in oppositedirections)indicatesthat
polarizationis multidimensional.

WhyDo We PerceiveMore Polarizationthan There Is?
 How do we explainthesharpgulfbetweenperceivedpolarizationin public discourseand observedstability(or convergence)in distributions    of
 public opinion?One set of explanationsmightrevolvearoundproblems
 ofsurveymethod.For example,Converse(1992) suggestedthatthereare
 "liberal"itemsand "conservative"   items(surveyquestionson issuesabout
 whichone ortheotherside feelsstrongly)    and thatsurveysthatoverrepresent one side will fail to pick up movementon the other.Because our
 measureaddressedmanyissues of interestto both sides of the political
 spectrum,we doubt thatthisinfluencedour findings.
    It is also possiblethatsurveysadapt too late to changingpoliticalcurrentsto capturepolarization.Surveysoftentryto probe attitudesabout
 timelyissueson whichthereis reasonto expectopinionto vary,and items
 withlow variance are morelikelythan thosewith high varianceto be
 dropped.Thus focusingonlyon questionsthathave been asked formany
years (as one must to studychange) may introducetwo kinds of bias:
 overestimation   ofpolarization,whenitemson whichpolarizationdeclines
 are droppedand thosewithhighvarianceare retained,and underestimation,because our itemsdo not tap opinionson issuesthatbecame politicized in the late 1980s (e.g.,public supportforthe arts).The stabilityof
the GSS seriesthrough1994,and the factthatNES and GSS measures
tellthesame story,make us doubtthatthesefactorsaffectedour results.
   It is, of course,entirelypossiblethatpeople perceivepolarizationthat
has not,in fact,occurred.This could be the case formanydifferent     reasons:
   1. Perhapschangehas occurrednot in what people believebut in the
intensity   withwhichtheybelieveit. The GSS and NES itemseffectively
tap cognitivediversityin opinion,but,exceptforthe feelingthermometers,theyare less usefulformeasuringintensity     of affect(Schumanand
Presser1981,chap. 9; Krosnickand Abelson 1994).
   2. Perceptionsof greaterconflictmay reflecta historicalamnesia that
perceivesthe past as less dividedthanit was. Moreover,our timeseries
maybeginat theconclusionofa periodofpoliticalpolarization,fromthe
early1960sto theearly1970s(Nie et al. 1976,p. 143; Page and Shapiro,
p. 9; but Glenn[1974]reportsno changefromtheearly1950sto thelate
1960s).In any case, to say thattheU.S. publicis notmorepolarizedthan
it was in the 1970s is not to say thatit is particularly
                                                       united.
   3. Views expressedin the media may have becomepolarized.Hunter
(1994,p. vii) pointsto thiswhenhe writesofpolarizationof"institutionalized and articulatedmoral visions"ratherthan of public opinionitself.
The extentto which conservativeviews are includedin public debate,
and therangeofpermissible     right-wingopinion,appearsto have increased
                                                           Social Attitudes

 in the 1980s,with the emergenceof conservativepolicyinstitutes,      talk
 radio,and conservativereligiousmedia (Messer-Davidow1993).29
    4. Polarizationmay be perceivedto increaseeven when it does not,if
 public positionsare taken in a harsher,more disputatiousmanner.An
 evidentdeclinein manyaspectsofculturalauthority       (DiMaggio and Bryson 1995) may be reflected  in weakenedinhibitionson public utterances
 of manykinds.
    5. Normativeconsensusmay coexistwith factualdisagreement.For
 example, social attitudesof African-Americans      and whites have converged;but when one looks not at what blacks and whitesbelieveto be
just and appropriate,  but ratherat what theybelieveto befactuallytrue,
 one sees sharpdivisions(Hochschild1995).
    6. Heightenedpartisanshipand electoralvolatilitymay reflectmoral
 or affective dissensus.Large declinesin confidencein institutions (Lipset
 and Schneider1987) and in othermeasuresof social cohesion(Putnam
 1995)mayincreaseperceivedpolarizationeven ifconfidence       is notpolarized,a topicaboutwhichwe knowlittle(butsee Fox and Firebaugh[1992]
 on trendsin genderdifferences   in confidencein science).
    7. Apparentpolarizationmayreflect    changesin resourcesavailable for
mobilizationby different   groups.For example,a declinein mobilization
of tradeunionistsand an increasein mobilizationof religiousconservativesmay alterpoliticalagendas withoutshifting     underlying  sentiments.
   8. Changesin thelevel at whichactorsmobilizemayalso alterperceptions.Local communities   have longbeen sitesofacrimoniouscontroversy
over race, schools,and morality(Coleman 1957),but conflictsover such
issues thatare organizednationallymay receivemoreattention.
   9. Shiftsin the relativeimportanceof formsof politicalparticipation
that tend to increase the extent of "representationbias" (Converse,
Clausen, and Miller 1965; Verba et al. 1995)-that is, a decline in the
importanceof votingor letterwritingand an increasein the importance
of cash contributions  or protest-may renderpoliticalconflictmoreapparent.
   10. Increasedpartisanshipmayreflect    institutionalchangesthatreduce
partyorganizations'disciplineoverdivisivecandidatesand officeholders
(Polsby1983).Or divisivesocial rhetoricmayreflect     strategiesofthepartiesthemselves.
   11. If citizensvote on the basis of identitiesthatare onlylooselycoupled to policypreferences-forexample,race,religion,region-theymay
supportcandidateson thebasis ofshrillsymbolicappeals withoutsharing
such candidates'polarizedissue preferences.

29   We are indebtedto RobertK. Mertonforthissuggestion.

   12. Politicalvolatilitymayreflectnot shiftingopinions,but shifting
                                                                    issue frames(Gamson 1992; Schumanand Presser1981; Snidermanet al.
1993). Shiftingframescan alterpoliticalagendas by alteringthe relative
salienceofdiffering attitudeseven whentheattitudesthemselvesremain
stablydistributed.
  This discussionraisesmorequestionsthanitresolves.Our purposeis to
suggestdirections ofinquirythatmightexplaintheparadoxofwidespread
beliefthatsocial-issuepoliticshave becomemorepolarizedeven though
opiniondata demonstrate    thatsocial attitudeshave not.

TheoreticalImplications
If our empiricalcontributionhas been to answerthequestionofwhether
the social opinionsof Americanshave polarized,our theoreticalpurpose
is to suggestthat polarizationis an aspect of public opinionworthyof
researchattention.To thisend,we distinguished  fourdimensionsofpolarization-dispersion,bimodality,constraint,  and consolidation-and developedserviceablemeansofoperationalizing   them.The empiricalresults
demonstrated  bothface validityand the partialindependenceof the dimensions.30 We now suggestthatthe studyof opinionpolarizationmay
be germaneto severalproblemsin social and politicaltheory.
                        and thespiralofsilence.-Several scholarshave
  Preferencefalsification
developed Noelle-Neumann's(1993) insightthat perceptionsof public
opinionare influencedby variationin the willingnessof personsholding
different opinionsto disclose theirviews to otherswho may not share
them.Granovetter  and Soong's model(1988)demonstrates   that,givencertaindistributionsoftoleranceofdisagreement,  minority opinionscan appear to be majorityviews.3'Kuran (1995a) distinguishesopinionsthatare
privatelyheldfromthosethatare publiclyexpressedand discussesfactors
thatlead to the rapid revelationof previouslyconcealedopinions.32 Be-
" The methodological  challengeis to developmeasurescapableofcomparing     dispersionon itemsand scaleswithdifferent    ranges,a problemwe did notface.
31 Somesupport  forthiscomesfromHuckfeldt    and Sprague's(1988,pp.477-78) study
of votersin a smallmidwestern    city,whichfoundthatmajorityvotersin a given
neighborhood   weremorewillingtodisclosetheirviewsto a memberoftheopposition
thanwerethosewho perceivethemselves       to be in a minority.
32 Do responses to "public-opinion"surveysrepresent  "public"or "private"opinion?
The literature is ambiguouson thisscore.If theformer,   as Noelle-Neumann   (1993)
implies,thentheyare usefulproxiesfortheperceivedrangeofpreferences,      butpoor
indicators ofunderlying preferences.If thelatter,thentheyare inadequatemeasures
ofsentiments  thatare publiclyexpressed, butadequateindicators ofunderlying  opinion. If thetestof"publicness" is whetherwhatsurveyrespondents     tellinterviewers
differs fromwhattheymightrevealto intimates,     thenthereis evidencethatsurveys

cause,as Granovetter                        processescan lead tominorargues,spiral-of-silence
itydominationofpublicdiscourse,and because,as Kuran argues,preference revelationis oftencentralto disjunctivesocial change,theseissues
are importantforpoliticalsociologists.
   Opinionrevelationin spiralprocessesis a probabilisticfunctionofindividual conflictaverseness,theavailabilityofdiscussionpartnerswithdifferingopinions,and the probabilitythat actors accuratelyidentifythe
preferences of thosewithwhom theycome into contact(Huckfeldtand
Sprague1988).Polarization,in thesenseofbimodalityand constraint,   will
enterintothisprocessin threeways.
   First,because opinionsare rarelydichotomous,reticenceto disclose
one's opinionis likelyto varypositivelywithopiniondistancebetween
actorand potentialdiscussant.The less bimodaltheopinionstructure,   the
greaterthelikelihoodofpoliticaldiscussionbetweenpeoplewho disagree
somewhat,and the greaterthe numberof discussantslikelyto discuss
theirviewswithpersonswho wouldnotrevealtheirsto one another.Thus
opinionbimodalitylimitsthe extentof open politicaldiscussionamong
personswithdifferent viewsand thetwo-stepflowofopinionacrossideologicallines.
  Second,theavailabilityofaccurateinformation    aboutopiniondistributionsis a positivefunctionof theproportionof errorsmade in predicting
others'opinions.Errorsfrustrate efforts by actorsto falsify(or withhold
information about)preferences thattheyfeardiscussionpartnersmayfind
unacceptable.Because predictionis easierwhencategoriesare dividedby
emptyspaces,greateropinionbimodalityenables actorsmoreeffectively
to predictthe views of those with whom theyinteract,thus increasing
disparitiesbetweenperceivedand real distributions   of opinion.
  Third,increasedopinionconstraint  intensifies spiralsin two ways.Because discussionabout one policyissue leads to discussionsof others,the


 ticsis littleunderstood).
                         If thetestof"publicness"is whetherwhatsurveyrespondents
 tellinterviewers is closerto their"private"opinionsthanwhattheymightsay,e.g.,
 in a roomfullof potentialbusinessassociatesaboutwhomtheyhave littleadvance
 information,   then surveyresponsesare almost certainlynot public in NoelleNeumann'ssense.Althoughthematterrequiresempiricalresolution         we are inclined
to viewsurveyresponsesin politically   opensocietiesas more"private"than"public,"
forthreereasons:the"relationship"     withthe interviewer is ephemeral,makingthe
costofdispleasinghimor herminimal;theinstitutional     framing  oftheinterview authorizestheexpressionof potentially    disagreeableopinionsand prohibits theinterviewerfromexpressing      disapproval,likewisereducingthe interviewee's  risk;and,
finally,  whereasthemostcommonformofpreference        falsification
                                                                 in everydaylifeis
failure to revealan opinion,the surveyrespondent     benton preference falsification
mustendorsean opinionwithwhichhe or she activelydisagrees.If we are correct,
thenpublicopinionsurveysmayrepresent         an institutional

theeffects   ofpreference falsification

 greaterthe level of opinionconstraint,  the less likelydiscussionpartners
 are to disagreeaboutissuessubsequentto theone on whichthediscussion

 (Coleman 1957,p. 14). In addition,thegreatertheopinionconstraint,      the
 easieritis to predicttheviewsofa potentialdiscussionpartnerin advance.
 (This is a fortioritrueof intergroup  polarization.)
   Median-votermodels.-The celebrated Hotelling-Downsmodel in
 public-choicetheorypredictsthatin two-party     democracieswithwinnertake-allelections(as opposed to proportionalrepresentation)     legislative
 deliberations  representtheviewsofthe"medianvoter"at thecenterofthe
 votingpublic'sopiniondistribution    (Downs 1957). Politicalentrepreneurs
 changetheirpositionsto maximizevotes,positioningthemselveson the
 leftorrightto capturenominations,   butthenmigrating   centerward  during
 generalelections.(Absenta thirdparty,theirideologicalsupporterswill
stickwiththem,havingnowhereelse to turn.)
   This modelapplies well to politiesin whichopinionsare normallydistributedon a singledimension.But as public-choicetheoristshave observed(Mueller1983,pp. 180-96),it worksless well whenopiniondistributionsare flat or bimodal. Once the median is no longerthe mode,
majoritiesmay formaround eithermode. If bimodalityis greatand the
issue salient,rationalcandidatesmayembraceextremepositionsin order
to preventa sit-outby puristsor a third-party    challenge.
   Effectsofbimodalitymaybe compoundedbydispersionand constraint.
Realisticmedian-voter   modelsplace specialweighton theviewsof"attentive publics"(Arnold1990),whose votesare morelikelyto be influenced
by a candidate's record.Because voterswho take extremepositionsare
moreattentivethan thosewho take moderateones (Converse1992),the
moredispersedthe opinion,the greaterthe size of attentivepublicsand
the accountability  of politiciansto them.Similarly,increasedconstraint,
entailingmoreinterdependence     amongissues,maymakeit harderforpoliticiansto satisfymobilizedvotersby logrolling.33    Thus we hypothesize:
thegreaterthebimodality,    theless electedofficials'views resemblethose
of the median voter,with this divergenceincreasingas dispersionand
constraintincrease.
   Parallel publics.-Page and Shapiro(1992) argue thatdifferent     group
views move in tandembecause membersof each groupreceivethesame
policy-relevant  information and consequently  changetheiropinionsin the
same directionat moreor less thesame rate,whiledifferences      in opinion

thatreflectreal differences in materialor ideal intereststendto remain
stable.Our resultson between-group  meandifferences  are consistentwith
this.Changesin within-group   polarization,however,do notalwaysmove
in tandem.
   How can we explainthe paradox of parallelintergroup    differences in
centraltendency,but inconsistent  shiftsin within-group distributions of
opinion?We hypothesizethat increasingwithin-group       polarizationreflectsone of two processes.For groupsbased on ascribedidentities,it
reflectsa declinein thecorrelationsofthefocalidentity withotheridentitiesor attributes(Blau 1977),whichincreaseswithin-group   heterogeneity
ofinterest and perspective.One mayspeculatethatthisfactor,as exemplifiedin thegrowthoftheAfrican-American      middleclass,may explaindiversificationin African-American opinionafter1980.For groupsin which
membershipis optional,diversityreflectsmigrationof personsintothat
category.For example, bimodalityof opinion on several issues grew
amongconservativesas theirnumbersincreased,but notamongliberals,
as theirsdeclined.
   Discussion.-These are but threeexamplesof the potentialrelevance
of opinionpolarizationto theexplanationof politicalphenomena.Other
examplescouldbe drawnfromtheoriesofgroupformation        and movement
effectiveness,whichare based on thefamiliarprinciplethatmobilization
is mostlikelywhen groups(a) hold verydifferent     opinionsand (b) are
internallyunified.By developinga theoretically   groundedset of operationaldefinitions,applyingthatapproachto thesubstantively    important
                      changesin U.S. social attitudesbetweenthe early
issue of distributional
1970sand themid-1990s,and suggesting    theoreticalapplications,thisdiscussion may inspirefurtherresearchon the measurementand consequences of distributionalpropertiesof public opinion.

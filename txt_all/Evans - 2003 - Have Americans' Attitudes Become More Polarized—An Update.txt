Have Americans’ Attitudes Become More
Polarized?—An Update n

John H. Evans, University of California, San Diego

Objective. I examine polarization in public opinion using the method of DiMaggio,
Evans, and Bryson (DEB) (1996), but go further than DEB by using newly
available years of survey data. Method. Like DEB, I derive aggregate distributional
parameters for social groups in each year of the surveys, and then regress the year of
the surveys on each parameter. Results. As in DEB’s original paper, there is little
evidence of general polarization in attitudes between the early 1970s and today.
However, while DEB found some evidence that polarization in the public may be
the result of polarization in our political system, with the additional years of data
this conclusion is inescapable. Conclusions. Although political scientists have
recently found polarization among our elected officials on economic issues, it
seems clear that members of the public who identify with the partisan labels of our
political system are becoming polarized on moral issues.


  Many scholars have claimed that the American public has become
increasingly polarized over a range of social issues in recent decades. Scholars
have claimed, for example, that there have been trends toward ‘‘ideological
polarization in domestic and social concerns’’ (Wyszomirski, 1994:37), that
there had been ‘‘sharpening cultural polarization of U.S. society after the
mid-1970s’’ (Ellison and Musick, 1993:379) and, most famously, that
American society is engaged in a ‘‘culture war’’ (Hunter, 1991, 1994). Are
these claims correct? In 1996, DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson (DEB) wrote a
paper called ‘‘Have Americans’ Social Attitudes Become More Polarized?’’
Using more than 20 years of General Social Survey (GSS) and National
Election Studies (NES) data, and examining four types of polarization for
18 social issues, in DEB we found little evidence of polarization. The only
exceptions were polarization in the general public and most subgroups on
the issue of abortion, and a growing polarization between people who selfidentify as Democrats and Republicans.

   The most recent data sets available to us for the DEB paper were the 1992
NES and the 1994 GSS. We found little polarization, despite the
predictions of social commentators, which could have been for one of
three reasons. First, and most obviously, it could be because there is indeed
little polarization in the public. Second, it could be because our statistical
models were based on at most 15 cases, with an average of 10, which
resulted from our methods, which required aggregation of the data for each
year of the survey. Despite using a generous p value of 0.10 to give the
benefit of the doubt to the polarization argument, trends must be quite
strong to be significant with only 10 cases. Third, we might not have found
polarization because it had not occurred yet. That is, the social critics might
have been prescient, observing the first indications of the underlying
causes of general polarization that would take nearly a decade more to
become apparent. The events of the 1990s, such as the ‘‘Contract with
America’’ and the Clinton presidency, may have finally created the predicted
polarization.
   With additional years of data I can evaluate the latter two interpretations. In this article I replicate our DEB study with the only
difference being that I have taken advantage of the completion of the
1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 NES, and the 1996, 1998, and 2000 GSS.
The purpose is to see whether, with the additional years of data and
additional statistical power, the conclusions of the DEB paper should be
modified.


Measuring Polarization

   There is a severe challenge in writing a paper such as this. In DEB we
committed large sections of our paper to deriving four types of polarization,
why they might be of substantive importance for social scientists, how they
might interact, and, most important, how they could be measured. Given
that my purpose is to replicate our earlier paper with additional data, and
given that I do not change or challenge any of these preliminaries, I do not
repeat this information, but refer the reader to DEB for an explanation and
justification of the measures.
   In DEB we offered a multidimensional and fairly comprehensive
theory and method for analyzing increasing or decreasing polarization in opinions. Below, I describe the four dimensions along which a
particular population may be considered more or less polarized across
time.
  1. The dispersion of opinions found in a given population may affect a
     group’s ability to arrive at political consensus. In DEB we used sample
     variance to measure dispersion. Increasing sample variance indicates
     increasing dispersion of opinion.


                                                                                 15406237, 2003, 1, Update on Polarization of American Attitudes                               73
  2. Bimodality—rifts in a distribution of opinions—is the extent to which
     opinions cluster into separate ‘‘camps.’’ Bimodality differs from
     dispersion in that it measures gaps in the distribution of responses
     rather than the average distance between them. DEB measured
     bimodality using kurtosis, with lower values of kurtosis indicative of
     greater polarization in this bimodal sense.
  3. Consolidation of opinion along some other set of socially significant
     lines (such as religious affiliation or social position). In DEB we
     operationalized this dimension as differences in the mean of variable
     between pairs of groups. This is the measure that has traditionally been
     used (alone) to measure opinion polarization (Page and Shapiro,
     1992:ch. 7; Brint, 1984:110–21).
  4. In DEB we also presented data on a fourth dimension—opinion
     constraint. This is ‘‘the extent to which opinions on any one item in an
     opinion domain y are associated with opinions on any other’’
     (DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson, 1996:696). This is an indicator of
     ideological cohesion, where a person’s views on one issue are
     increasingly predictable by their views on a related one. In DEB we
     measured constraint with Cronbach’s alpha, which, while usually used
     to measure scale reliability, can also be interpreted as the degree of
     association among the items in the scale due to the latent variable
     beneath them.


Data, Measures, and Analytic Strategy

   Following DEB, I use the General Social Survey (GSS) (Davis and Smith,
1972–2000) and the National Election Studies (NES) (Sapiro et al., 2001).
I defined the same attitude scales and subpopulations as we did in DEB. I
refer the reader to DEB for details of the various coding decisions we made
(see primarily pp. 699–705). From the NES I have indicators of attitudes
toward government aid to minorities, abortion, women’s roles, and feelings
toward African Americans, poor people, liberals, and conservatives. I also
have an omnibus scale that combines these scales into one measure. For the
GSS I have scales for attitudes toward abortion, women’s public roles, family
gender roles, sexuality, racism, crime and justice, sex education, school
prayer, divorce law, and an omnibus scale. The individual components of all
these scales have been recoded so that more ‘‘conservative’’ responses receive
higher numbers. Because all the attitude measures in the NES except the
omnibus measure are single questions, there are no Cronbach’s alpha
analyses (constraint) for these variables. Because the sex education, school
prayer, and divorce law variables of the GSS are dichotomous, and because
the variance and kurtosis of a dichotomous variable provides no more
information than its mean, those attitude measures are used only in the
analyses that compare the means of groups over time.


                                                                                    15406237, 2003, 1, 74                                                    Social Science Quarterly
Analytic Strategy

   I have decided to exactly replicate the methods we used in DEB, not only
so that direct comparisons can be made, but also because other possible
methods are impractical. There are other possible methods that could have
been used to measure polarization, although they typically can be used only
for one dimension of polarization. For example, public opinion researchers
have long examined interaction terms between a group and a year variable to
determine whether the means of two groups are diverging (Page and
Shapiro, 1992). DEB’s consolidation measure is a close relative of this
technique. Similarly, others have split data into two time periods and
compared the variances of a group between the two periods using a F test
(Gay, Ellison, and Powers, 1996). This method, while related to our use of
dispersion (variance) in DEB, requires that two years or two sets of years
be focused upon, often without substantive justification for the choice
of years.
   Since the publication of DEB, Hoffmann and Miller (1998) have built on
DEB’s framework to control for other variables that may be causing
polarization over time—essentially creating multivariate variance and
kurtosis trend models. Unfortunately, their method cannot determine the
relative contribution of each variable toward a polarization trend: it only
removes that part of the polarization attributable to the control variable. In a
subsequent paper, I (2002) used Hoffmann and Miller’s technique, as well
as the logic of sensitivity analysis, to try to determine the underlying cause of
polarization on abortion. While this is an interesting and useful approach,
the data-reporting requirements are so immense that it cannot be used for
more than a few comparisons.
   Recently, Mouw and Sobel (2001) criticized the methodology used in
DEB for, among other things, not being sensitive to the fact that none of the
attitude scales in DEB were truly continuous variables, and suggested an
analysis using contingency tables. As we pointed out in a response (Evans,
Bryson, and DiMaggio, 2001), this method is quite useful for examination
of dispersion over time, but cannot be used to examine the other forms of
polarization, and explicitly assumes that there is no bi-modality. Like
Hoffmann and Miller’s approach, it is also impractical for large numbers of
analyses. Moreover, Mouw and Sobel report that their method can be used
only with single variables, not with additive scales, which make up a
majority of the analyses in the original paper. I was therefore unable to use
the innovation of Mouw and Sobel.
   Finally, Downey and Huffman (2001) recently determined that kurtosis,
while still measuring bi-modality, is insensitive to the fact that some opinion
distributions may actually be tri-modal. They found that 22 percent of the
variables they examined in the GSS had ‘‘truly trimodal’’ distributions.
Unfortunately, they find it ‘‘impossible to offer a satisfactory alternative at
this point,’’ but simply suggest that researchers look for tri-modality in the


                                                                                                  15406237, 2003, 1, Update on Polarization of American Attitudes                                               75
actual distributions before assessing summary statistics (2001:501). Given
that no superior alternative is offered, I examined the actual distributions
and found little evidence of tri-modality.1
  As with DEB, a summary statistic that corresponds with a type of
polarization is created for each group in each year under study. For example,
the variance on the omnibus scale for respondents with a college education
in 1977 is one data point. To make claims about trends in polarization, I
examine the change over time in each of these parameters for each of the
groups under study. For examination of within-group polarization, I simply
regress the year of the survey on the value of the parameter (mean, variance,
kurtosis, or alpha). An increase in variance and/or alpha, and a decrease in
kurtosis, is indicative of increased polarization.2
  For examination of between-group polarization (consolidation), I regress
the year of the study on the absolute difference between the mean of the two
groups. An increase in this difference is indicative of increased betweengroup polarization. To emphasize again, these are all simple regressions
because (1) multivariate models, while developed, are not practical (see
above), and (2) there are very few cases in each model. Since there are few
cases in each model, formal statistical analyses to determine whether the
degree of polarization has changed in recent years cannot be conducted.
Instead, I am left with making a somewhat more limited analysis, which is
whether, after replicating the entire study, we are left with different
conclusions about polarization in the United States.


Regression Strategies

   As in DEB, I rely on ordinary least squares regression to summarize the
trend in polarization. One challenge to this approach is that because DEB
used group/year as the unit of analysis, there are at best as many cases as
there are years of the survey, but often fewer, because not all questions were
asked in all years. The largest number of cases in any of the analyses is then
    I am unaware of any measure of tri-modality. Rather, one must look at a histogram and
decide whether it has three distinct humps. Combining all the years of data and looking at
the distribution for each variable, the only variable that might be interpreted as tri-modal is
the GSS sexual morality scale, but even this is questionable. A more difficult question is what
to make of the NES feeling thermometers, which are 100-point Likert scales. As is well
known, respondents do not pick the ‘‘in between’’ numbers (e.g., 62), but rather the ‘‘round’’
numbers (e.g., 60). Therefore, the feeling thermometer variables are all multimodal, with
responses concentrated at the ‘‘round’’ numbers. My understanding of the behavior of the
kurtosis statistic suggests that this does not create the sort of problem that Downey and
Huffman identify, but, clearly, additional research is required on the topic of measuring bimodality in noncontinuous variables.
    The GSS does not provide sampling weights. There are, however, a few years where the
GSS oversampled African Americans. Due to the complexity of using weights in the analysis
(see below), instead of weighting the cases in these years, we followed the common practice of
removing the respondents who were part of the oversample. Therefore, there were no weights
used for the GSS.


                                                                                   15406237, 2003, 1, 76                                                    Social Science Quarterly
18 and the lowest is seven. In any analysis with so few cases one must be
particularly concerned that idiosyncratic cases do not unduly influence the
analysis. To guard against this possibility, I reran all of the analyses in this
article using a robust regression model where influential cases are downweighted so as to not unduly influence the results (Western, 1995;
StataCorp, 2001). Neither type of analysis is more true than the other, they
are simply different ways of summarizing the data.


Results

  DEB presented graphical depictions of the change in polarization over
time as well as tables summarizing the graphs. In this article, to save space, I
do not present graphs and present tables summarizing only the parts of the
analysis I discuss most extensively. Full tables, equivalent in form to those
presented in DEB, as well as similar tables with the robust regression results,
are available at /www.sociology.ucsd.edu/BjhevansS. In the text, I describe
only the OLS models and note when the robust models differ. As we did in
DEB, I start with examining polarization in the entire sample, move on to
polarization within subsamples of the population and finally to polarization
between groups.


Within-Group Polarization in the Population as a Whole

  The most general examination of polarization is whether the entire
population is polarizing on social issues in general (see Column 1 in
Table 1). To examine this I analyze trends in the omnibus scales, which are
compilations of all the different variables. As in DEB I found no evidence of
overall polarization. Even with the additional years of data, the NES scale is
constant over time in variance, kurtosis, and alpha. As in DEB, the GSS
scale continues to show a decrease in the dispersion (variance) type of
polarization (–1.944). Therefore, as with DEB, the conclusion is that
polarization in this most general of senses is not occurring within the general
public. However, these variables are very blunt instruments. As a first step
toward sharpening our tools, I examine whether the general public is
becoming more polarized on individual issues.

   Race and Poverty. As in DEB, the GSS racial-attitude scale demonstrates
a trend toward less polarization in racial attitudes, with declines in variance
and increases in kurtosis (see Column 1 in Table 1). A change from DEB is
that now alpha is also shown to be decreasing (–0.005), suggesting an even
fuller decline in polarization. As in DEB, the variance indicator of
polarization in the NES aid to minorities variable suggests decreasing
polarization (–0.029), but with the additional years of data, the kurtosis


                                                                                                   15406237, 2003, 1, Update on Polarization of American Attitudes                                                77
measure suggests decreasing polarization as well (0.015). The feelings
toward African Americans variable in the NES shows no change in
polarization over time.3
   With the additional data there is then a slight change in interpretation
from DEB. While DEB reported that attitudes toward government aid for
minorities seemed to become more polarized from the mid-1980s on, with
more data we see that this was not actually a trend. Finally, as in DEB,
feelings toward poor people have polarized over the time period as indicated by
an increasing variance (2.524) and decreasing kurtosis (–0.018). Therefore, the
conclusion from this replication is the same as in DEB for poverty, but there is
now more evidence of a decline in polarization over race.

  Gender. In DEB, the three scales representing gender issues become less
polarized over time in all available measures. This conclusion remains
unchanged with the additional years of data.

   Crime and Justice. Although the GSS crime and justice scale, as in DEB,
shows a decline in variance (–0.004) and a rise in kurtosis (0.022), a
previously significant decline in constraint is now showing no change. This
suggests slightly less evidence for declining polarization than we reported in
DEB.

   Attitudes Toward Liberals and Conservatives. In DEB we were interested
in whether Americans have become more polarized in their reaction to
political labels. As in DEB, the answer from the NES data is that Americans
are not becoming more polarized, with the exception of a slight polarizing
trend in bi-modality (kurtosis) on feelings toward conservatives (–0.017).

    Abortion and Sexuality. Abortion was the one issue where we found
unambiguous evidence of polarization in the general population. Here I find
that the extent of polarization on abortion remains the same as reported in
DEB, with the GSS and NES showing polarization in all senses of the term.
However, in DEB we did not put too much interpretive weight on the
across-time analysis of the NES abortion variable because we suspected that
a change in wording mid-way through the series would affect the results—a
suspicion confirmed by Mouw and Sobel (2001). I will therefore not discuss
the NES abortion measure separately from this point forward.4
   In DEB we found no polarization in the sexual morality scale. With the
additional years of data I do find evidence of increasing polarization. Despite
    There is a significant polarizing trend in kurtosis in the OLS model shown in Table 1, but
the coefficient in the robust model is not significant (not shown). Therefore, because this
trend seems to be due to outliers, I note the different conclusions here but will interpret this
variable as not changing from that reported in DEB.
    The NES abortion variable remains in the omnibus measure so that this study can be
compared to DEB. The change is slight enough that it should not unduly perturb the
omnibus scale since it is comprised of so many elements.

increasing liberalism on the issue (e.g., a declining mean, not shown),
compared to DEB the coefficient for kurtosis is statistically significant
(–0.026).

   Conclusions about Polarization in the General Public. Attitudes toward
race, gender, crime and justice, and feelings toward liberals and conservatives
all are declining in polarization, as found in DEB. I also find the
polarization that DEB found in the general public in attitudes toward
abortion, but I find more evidence that attitudes toward sexuality are
polarizing. I will discuss possible explanations and interpretations of these
findings after presenting all the results.


Within-Group Polarization in Subgroups

   Although looking at individual issues is a sharper tool than looking at all
issues combined, it will sharpen our tools even more to look at polarization
for each issue within particular subgroups in the population. In Columns
2–5 of Table 1 I report these findings, but will describe only the findings
that are different from the polarization (or lack thereof) found in the general
population. By ‘‘different’’ I mean a situation where a polarization trend is
statistically significant in one case and not in another.

   Participants in the Political System. DEB had two ways of measuring
political participation—voting and a series of questions that asked about
engagement in political acts. DEB found that people who had voted in the
last presidential election had a slight tendency toward more polarization.
With additional years of data that difference has disappeared—voters are not
appreciably different from the rest of the population in terms of polarization
(see Column 2 in Table 1).
   On the other hand, and in contrast to DEB, the politically active in the
NES show polarization in variance on the omnibus scale (Column 3 in
Table 1).5 DEB found that the politically active were not polarizing in
attitudes to the poor while the general population was. I find here that the
politically active are, like the public, becoming more polarized. DEB also
found that this group was more polarized in variance in their feelings toward
liberals, while the general public was not. Now I find polarization in both
variance and kurtosis not only on feelings toward liberals, but toward
conservatives as well.6 In sum, there is now evidence that the politically
    They also show increasing alpha (constraint) in OLS models, but this is contradicted by
the robust models.
    A difference from DEB in the variance trend in aid to minorities, shown in Table 1, is not
supported by the robust models.


                                                                                   15406237, 2003, 1, Update on Polarization of American Attitudes                                 81
active are becoming more polarized—and particularly polarized on the most
political of matters, feelings toward liberals and conservatives.

   College Graduates. Like the politically active, it is plausible that the more
highly educated members are more attentive to discourse on social issues and
therefore may become more polarized. We may also expect to find
polarization due to the higher levels of political activism among the
educated, as well as the growing racial and religious diversity of the college
educated population.
  In DEB we found scattered evidence of not so much increases in
polarization among college graduates but a resistance to the declines that the
general population was making. We found that unlike the general public,
college graduates showed no decline in variance on the GSS omnibus scale,
which is still true in the present analysis, or in attitudes toward racial
integration, which is no longer true (see Column 4 in Table 1). DEB found,
and the present analysis concurs, that college graduates show no increase in
kurtosis for racial attitudes, while the general population has. Both DEB and
this analysis also find no decline in alphas for attitudes toward women’s
public roles, while the general population had such a decline. As before,
there is no consistent story to tell about polarization among the college
educated.
   Young People. It could be the next generation that is polarizing,
suggesting that concerns of general polarization are simply ahead of their
time. Looking for polarization among those between the ages of 18 and 29
when they filled out the survey, DEB found that the ‘‘differences between
young people and the general public are numerous but inconclusive’’
because some measures suggested increased polarization and some decreased
polarization (DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson, 1996:720). All but a few of the
differences with the general public noted in DEB have disappeared with the
addition of the extra years of data, but additional differences have replaced
them (see the final column in Table 1). In the present analysis, the young are
different from the general public in not exhibiting declining polarization in
family gender roles (kurtosis), racial attitudes (kurtosis), and aid to
minorities (kurtosis and variance). Yet, they are also different from the
general public in not exhibiting a decrease in kurtosis (increasing
polarization) in sexual morality or attitudes toward the poor. In sum, the
polarization among the young remains inconclusive.
   Summary. Like we did in DEB, I looked for polarization in each separate
issue within each of a number of subpopulations. In DEB we concluded that
this exercise resulted in no clear pattern of polarization within any one
population. Additional years of data result in similar conclusions. However,
there does seem to be more evidence now for polarization among the
politically active than there was in DEB.

Polarization as Between-Group Difference

   In this section I examine whether polarization is occurring not within
groups, but between groups (consolidation). For each pair of contrasting
groups I calculate the absolute value of the difference in means of the two
groups, and regress this value on the year of the survey. If the difference is
increasing, then this is evidence of polarization between the groups.
   As in DEB, if I find polarization between two groups, I also consider
whether there is increasing bi-modality within each of the two groups,
although these statistics are not reported in the tables. The reasoning here is
that I am only interested in between-group difference because of its potential
for conflict. However, if one or both of the groups is becoming internally
polarized, then its ability to conflict with the other group—despite its
growing distance—is greatly diminished and any observed between-group
difference is of lessened importance.
   Age. In DEB we found no instances of increasing between-group
difference between those less than 35 years old and those over 45. Indeed,
we found that 12 of 18 measures showed convergence in attitudes. The
additional data used in this article does not change this finding (see Column
1 in Table 2). With the full 1972–2000 data, I find that 13 of 17 measures
showed convergence, and four showed no convergence or divergence.7
   Educational Attainment. Much sociological theory, such as the theory of
the ‘‘new class’’ (Gouldner, 1979; Brint, 1984), would suggest that there is a
growing divide between groups based on their education. Instead,
comparing those with a college degree to those with no more than a high
school diploma, in DEB we found convergence on 9 of 18 measures, and
polarization on none. With the additional years of data I now find
convergence on 12 of 17, but with polarization on one—school prayer. (In
DEB, school prayer was just short of showing polarization.) However, the
overall theme is clear: if anything, there is even less evidence of polarization
between educational groups than when we conducted the analyses for DEB.
   Gender. Political scientists have identified a gender gap in voting
behavior, but in DEB we found little evidence of the gender gap in
attitudes. We found a small degree of polarization on the NES omnibus
scale, convergence in attitudes toward crime and sex education, and no
convergence or divergence on the other issues. With the additional data
there remains no large amount of polarization by gender.
   Race. In DEB we found no instances of increasing polarization and many
instances of decreasing polarization between African Americans and whites.
With the new data the results are substantively identical. On no issue is there
    There is one less measure because I am no longer considering the NES abortion item
separately.


                                                                                              15406237, 2003, 1, 84                                                           Social Science Quarterly
increasing polarization, but there is decreasing polarization in the NES
omnibus scale, feelings toward African Americans, the poor, liberals, and
conservatives, as well as on aid to minorities and abortion (GSS). The issues
where opinion is not converging generally have to do with the status of
women and sexuality. That is, African-American and white attitudes toward
women’s roles (NES), family gender roles (GSS), women’s public roles
(GSS), sexual morality,8 sex education, and divorce law are not converging.
Additionally, African Americans and whites are not converging on school
prayer, racial attitudes (GSS), and the GSS omnibus scale. The only change
from DEB is that African Americans and whites are no longer converging on
the crime and justice scale.

    Religion. To many, polarization between religious groups is what is
assumed to be driving all polarization (Hunter, 1991, 1994). DEB relied on
a fairly crude religious division between ‘‘religious conservatives’’ and
‘‘religious liberals’’ to not only make measurement possible, but to
operationalize the central claims about polarization that had been made
by others. Others have broken religious groups into smaller categories to
look for polarization on particular variables, with interesting results (Evans,
2002; Hoffmann and Miller, 1997, 1998). For comparability with DEB, I
retain the coding we used then.
   In DEB we found that religious liberals and conservatives were not
polarizing, as is commonly assumed, but instead had been converging on
seven of nine issues. Of the GSS variables, the only issues where they did not
converge were crime and justice and school prayer. With the additional data
used in this article, the results remain exactly the same.

   Region. In DEB we hypothesized that the well-documented differences in
opinion between residents of the South and residents of the rest of the
country may reflect polarization processes at work. While the continued
growth of a national culture through television and other media would
suggest a declining polarization, the growth of the Republican party in the
South, which emphasized social issues, suggests at least the possibility that
polarization may be occurring. In DEB we found no evidence of
polarization. Instead, moderate to large differences in attitudes between
the South and the non-South either remained constant over the time series
or declined. The additional data used in this article makes absolutely no
difference—the same variables that were converging then are converging
now.9
   Inspection of a scatter plot (not shown) reveals that this nonconvergence is actually
masking a rapid merger in views from 1974 to about 1990, and then a rapid polarization,
with African Americans starting off as very liberal and ending up as very conservative, and
whites starting out as very conservative and ending up as very liberal.
   In the OLS models, there is a slight polarization in attitudes toward African Americans
(NES). This trend was present but smaller and nonsignificant in DEB. However, in the


                                                                                                 15406237, 2003, 1, Update on Polarization of American Attitudes                                              85
    Ideology. Polarization may be a political reality if political identities
become linked to particular social attitudes. For example, people who selfidentify as ‘‘conservatives’’ may come to think that being a ‘‘conservative’’
means being opposed to abortion, women’s participation in public life, sex
education, etc. ‘‘Liberals’’ might think of themselves as defined by their
support of these issues. Thus, polarization could be occurring between selfidentified conservatives and liberals.
   In DEB we found a few cases of convergence in attitudes (attitudes toward
the poor, aid to minorities, and women’s public roles), but primarily no
change in the gulf that separates liberals and conservatives. We did, however,
find one clear case of polarization: in attitudes toward abortion. To ‘‘be a
conservative’’ or to ‘‘be a liberal’’ became more tightly connected to abortion
attitudes over the years of that study (for a similar result, see Hout (1999)).
   With the additional years of data, we now see that this polarization was
indicative of a broader trend that was only beginning to appear when DEB
was written. The polarization we found in DEB is also found with the
expanded data, but I also find polarization between liberals and conservatives
in attitudes toward sex education and school prayer. Additionally, while in
DEB attitudes toward women’s public roles were converging between
liberals and conservatives, with the additional years of data this no longer
holds true. It appears that the ‘‘liberal’’ and ‘‘conservative’’ labels have
increasingly become markers of positions on social issues over time (Miller
and Hoffmann, 1999).

    Party Identification. In DEB we concluded that the mechanisms that
political scientists have identified that attract parties to the political center
seem to have broken down because we identified nine issues where
Democrats and Republicans had become more polarized, and eight where
they had remained constant in their differences. While this polarization has
been observed among elected officials (Poole and Rosenthal, 2001), it has
not been observed in the general public. With the additional years of data we
see that when the data used by DEB ended in 1994 we were simply
seeing the early signs of a much more significant trend. With the additional
data, 14 of 17 variables I examined show polarization between Democrats
and Republicans, while only three do not change (there are no
convergences).
   In DEB we noted divergence in the NES and GSS omnibus scales,
abortion, feelings toward the poor, liberals, and conservatives, as well as in
attitudes toward crime and justice, racial attitudes, and divorce law. These
trends all continued in the new analyses. However, there is now polarization
between the parties in attitudes toward aid to minorities, women’s roles
(NES), family gender roles (GSS), sexual morality, and school prayer.

robust model (not shown), there is not polarization, suggesting that this finding is driven by
outliers.


                                                                                               15406237, 2003, 1, 86                                                            Social Science Quarterly
   While this might suggest increasing conflict between the parties,
examination of the extent of internal polarization within each party (results
not shown) suggests that on some of the issues this may not occur. While the
two groups are separating in their mean opinion, the Republicans are
becoming increasingly internally polarized over feelings toward the poor,
feelings toward liberals, and abortion. Both groups are becoming more
internally polarized on attitudes toward sexual morality. Internal divisions
should lessen the willingness of the group to do battle on an issue. If there
are any issues that are more prone to conflict due to the increasing
polarization between the groups, it is in aid to minorities and women’s roles
(NES), because in these two cases polarization between groups is
accompanied by decreasing polarization within both groups, suggesting
that there will be greater support for any conflict within each group. That
said, it is clear that with additional years of data there is evidence that
instances of polarization between the parties has increased since the analyses
conducted for DEB.10
   Conclusions. As DEB found, there is little evidence of increasing
polarization and more evidence of decreasing polarization between groups,
including groups commonly thought to be polarizing, such as men and
women, the young and the old, those with greater and lesser amounts of
education, African Americans and whites, residents of the South and
residents of the rest of the country, and religious conservatives and liberals.
The one exception found in DEB was increasing polarization between those
who identify as Democrats and those who identify as Republicans. With the
additional years of data this polarization has broadened to encompass more
issues. Also, whereas DEB found polarization only between self-identified
liberals and self-identified conservatives on the abortion issue, polarization
between these two groups has broadened as well, with polarization now
occurring on the issues of sex education and school prayer.


Summary and Discussion of Differences in Polarization Findings

  The last years of data used for the DEB paper were the 1992 NES and the
1994 GSS. Much has transpired in U.S. society since that point, and
replicating the analysis of DEB with updated data allows me to see if any
changes in our conclusions about polarization in American society should be
made.
  A secondary theme in the DEB paper was the idea that polarization may
simply be the result of the agendas of political movements. We had framed
our analysis not to test this idea explicitly, but more to assess the claim that
     With robust models, the school prayer variable does not show significant polarization.
However, while the OLS model for the sex education variable is not significant, it is in the
robust model.

polarization was the result of some macro-societal phenomena. Evidence for
the influence of political movements was at best suggestive, so it was not
emphasized. The particular patterns of newfound polarization in this article
suggest that the primary polarization occurring in the United States is that
political activists are becoming more polarized over the issues that have been
of concern to politically active religious conservatives.
  Support for this interpretation comes from the following. First,
polarization seems to be occurring on issues that are important to politically
active religious conservatives, such as abortion, sexuality, divorce law, school
prayer, and the like. Second, it is now clear that the primary instances of
between-group polarization are between people who are somehow identified
with politics, not with their gender, religion, race, or some other identity.
Note that it is not the marginally politically involved who are polarizing—
such as voters—but those who identify with the partisan labels in the
political system—people who label themselves liberals or conservatives,
Democrats or Republicans.
  In sum, with the additional years of data we have a more fine-grained
interpretation of polarization in America. In contrast to our conclusion in
DEB that there was really little polarization in America with the exception of
abortion and some polarization between Democrats and Republicans, it is
now safe to say that these are simply indicative of what is now a broader
pattern of polarization between those who identify with the labels of
political life in the United States.
  It is important to add that this polarization over the issues of concern to
politically active religious conservatives is not accompanied by polarization
between religious conservatives and religious liberals. This could be for any
number of reasons. First, the categories could be too blunt. Second, there is
a difference between the politically active in the religious traditions and
everyone else. Third, the political agendas of politically active religious
organizations might actually not have religious traditions as their base.


Conclusions

  In DEB we concluded by asking why there was the perception of
polarization when there was little evidence of polarization among the
population. We outlined 12 possible explanations. In light of the additional
years of data, which found an even more striking polarization based on
political identifications, I think I can narrow those 12 down to two prime
suspects—the polarization of political parties and a crystallization of the
meaning of ‘‘liberal’’ and ‘‘conservative.’’
  Political scientists have found that polarization between Democrats and
Republicans in Congress declined from the beginning of the 20th century
until World War II, was stable until the late 1970s, and since then has been
increasing (Poole and Rosenthal, 2001:18–19). If anything, Poole and


                                                                                                    15406237, 2003, 1, 88                                                               Social Science Quarterly
Rosenthal conclude, the 1990s show an acceleration of the trend. While
Bartels has noted that ‘‘we know less than we should about the nature and
extent of mass-level reactions to these elite-level developments’’ (2000:44),
other political scientists have concluded that the increasing partisanship of
our elected officials has increased the partisanship of the general public
(Hetherington, 2001:629). The present study suggests that polarization is
occurring between people who identify with the two parties. Of course, it is
beyond the scope of this article to determine whether polarization in the
attitudes of the party identifiers changed the voting behavior of our
representatives or the behavior of our representatives has changed the view of
the party identifiers. I will leave that to my colleagues in political science to
determine.
    Poole and Rosenthal also emphasize that this polarization is increasingly
between the (Republican) rich and the (Democratic) poor and see the
primary issue as the redistribution of wealth (McCarty et al., 1997). In DEB
and in this article I examined only two attitude questions that pertain to
income redistribution—attitudes toward the poor and aid to minorities—
and the results were ambiguous. While Poole and Rosenthal briefly mention
that ‘‘gender, sexual orientation, abortion and other issues areas generally
also map onto this dimension’’ (2001:7), they retain their focus on
redistribution, partly due to the limitations of their data, I believe. Scholars
in this tradition should consider whether social issues polarize our elected
officials, given that these issues seem to be polarizing the rank-and-file
political activists.
    One final analysis using the GSS (not shown) reveals an increase over time
in the likelihood that a person identifying as a Republican also identifies as a
‘‘conservative,’’ and that a person identifying as a Democrat identifies as a
‘‘liberal.’’11 This suggests that the polarization observed in the people who
identify with these terms is related to the polarization between the parties.
Additionally, Miller and Hoffmann (1999) find that the label ‘‘conservative’’ is increasingly used by the religiously orthodox and the label ‘‘liberal’’
by the religiously progressive. This all points to attitude polarization driven
by elites associated with the political system.
    A final point should be made. DEB’s stated motivation was to test claims
by Hunter and others that America is in a ‘‘culture war.’’ A tension in
Hunter’s claims was that at times he would use public opinion data to
investigate polarization (Hunter, 1991, 1994:ch. 4), but at other times
would argue that the conflict he identified would not be observed in the
general public (1994:vii), but was restricted to elites in the political system,
     This was a regression using the GSS data with party identification as the dependent
variable, and the liberal/conservative scale, year and a liberal/conservative-year interaction as
independent variable. The interaction term was significant, indicating that conservatives have
become more associated with the Republican party over time and that liberals have become
more associated with the Democratic party over time. See /http://www.scoiology.ucsd.edu/

such as social movement activists. The findings above suggest that the latter
strand in Hunter’s work is more accurate, and should be pursued. If so, we
would then need to ask why this elite polarization does not spread to the
average citizen.

                                                             We constrain a unified dark matter (UDM) model from the latest observational data. This model
                                                           assumes that the dark sector is degenerate. Dark energy and dark matter are the same component.
                                                           It can be described by an affine equation of state PX = p0 + αρX . Our data set contains the

                                                           which means a flat universe is strongly supported and the speed of sound of the dark sector seems

                                               Cosmic acceleration is one of the most striking discoveries in modern cosmology [1]. Many works have been done to
                                             explain this unexpected phenomenon. There are different mechanisms for the universe acceleration. The most popular
                                             idea is assuming a new component with negative pressure known as dark energy. Other mechanisms contain various
                                             modifications of gravitation theory [3] and violation of cosmological principle [2]. There are all kinds of dark energy
                                             models including quintessence [4], holographic dark energy [5], quintom [6], phantom [7], generalized Chaplygin gas
                                             model [8] and so on. Among these, the simplest and most successful model is ΛCDM model [9] while it has to face
                                             some theoretical problems. For example, the ”coincidence” problem and the ”fine-tuning” problem [10]. From this
                                             standard model, the flat universe consists of ∼ 4% baryons, ∼ 23% dark matter, ∼ 73% dark energy [11]. However,
                                             we still know little about dark matter and dark energy [12]. All we can feel about them are their gravitational effects.
                                             Observationally, they are degenerate. Based on these, a unified dark matter model was proposed which assumes that
                                             dark matter and dark energy are from a same dark component [13]. Since the equation of state of the unified dark


                                             ∗ Electronic address: zhuzh@bnu.edu.cn
component is unknown, we assume that it has a constant speed of sound c2s = α which is equivalent to the affine form
[14]. In order to break the degeneracies, different kinds of observational data are used to constrain cosmological model,
among which SNe Ia, CMB, and BAO are usually used to constrain cosmological parameters [15]. Recently, other
observations are included. For example, the gamma-ray burst [16], cluster gas mass fraction [17], lensing [18] and so
on. But these processes need to integrate the Hubble parameter to obtain the distance scale. The more information
about H(z) can’t be embodied. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the H(z) data directly. The expression of the
Hubble parameter can be written in this form

                                                                1 dz
                                                   H(z) = −            ,                                               (1)
                                                              1 + z dt

which depends on the differential age as a function of redshift. Based on Jimenez et al. [20], Simon et al. [21] used the
age of evolving galaxies and got nine H(z) data. Many works based on these nine data was done [22]. Recently, Stern
et al. [25] revised these data at 11 redshifts from the differential ages of red-envelope galaxies. Moreover, Gaztañaga
et al. [26] took the BAO scale as a standard ruler in the radial direction, obtained three more additional data.
  In this paper, we use the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to give constraints on the unified dark
matter model from the latest data including the observational Hubble parameter data. In section 2, we give a brief
introduction of the UDM model. In section 3, we introduce the observational data set we use. The full parameter
space using different combinations of data is exhibited in section 4. Finally, we give a conclusion in section 5.


                   2.   UNIFIED DARK MATTER WITH CONSTANT SPEED OF SOUND


  In this section, we give a brief introduction to unified dark matter model. For details of this model, please refer to
[13].
  Considering the universe is described by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric and assuming a single UDM
besides baryons and radiation, the Friedmann equation is expressed as

                                                    H(a) = H0 E(a),                                                    (2)

where H0 represents the Hubble constant today, and

                                       E(a)2 = Ωr (a) + Ωb (a) + ΩX (a) + Ωk (a),                                      (3)

where Ωi (a) = ρi (a)/ρc , ρc is the critical density today. The subscripts r, b, k and X represent for radiation, baryons,
curvature and UDM component respectively. Each component satisfies the energy-momentum conservation equation

                                                   ρ̇i = −3H(ρi + Pi ).                                                (4)

  For the radiation and baryons, the equations of state are 1/3 and 0, respectively. The conservation equation gives
Ωb (a) ∝ a−3 and Ωr (a) ∝ a−4 .
  For the UDM, it is considered as an approximation to an barotropic fluid. Since the equation of state PX = PX (ρX )
is unknown, we assume a constant speed of sound

                                                     dPX /dρX ≃ α,                                                     (5)
which leads to the 2-parameter affine form

                                                   PX ≃ p0 + αρX .                                             (6)

  Combined with the conservation equation, we can regard this component as an effective cosmological constant plus
a generalized dark matter which has a constant equation of state α. The density evolves as

                                             ΩX (a) = ΩΛ + (Ω̃m )a−3(1+α) ,                                    (7)

where Ω̃m = ΩXo − ΩΛ stands for the generalized dark matter, and ΩΛ stands for the effective cosmological constant
component, ρ̇Λ = 0.
  The Friedmann equation now can be expressed as

                      E(a)2 = Ωr a−4 + Ωb a−3 + ΩΛ + (1 − Ωb − Ωr − ΩΛ )a−3(1+α) + Ωk a−2 ,                    (8)

where Ωr , Ωb and Ωk represent dimensionless radiation, baryon matter and curvature today. ΩΛ and α are the
parameters we introduced. We notice that when α = 0, the UDM model are equivalent to ΛCDM. In
UDM model, we can equivalently think that the generalized dark matter may has a non-zero equation
of state. Naturally, because the property of the effective cosmological constant component is the same
as the one in ΛCDM, when the property of generalized dark matter is equivalent to the usual dark
matter in ΛCDM, UDM model totally becomes ΛCDM.
  The speed of sound characterizes the perturbations to the dark matter density and pressure which
are related to the microphysics. Since we know litter about dark sector in our universe, the equation
of state is introduced to describe the property of dark sector.               However, it can not give us the
information about the microphysics and other properties. The speed of sound can give information
about the internal degrees of freedom. For example, quintessence has cs = 1. If we can confirm the
sound speed that is below the speed of light, we can get further degrees beyond a canonical, minimally
coupled scalar field. If the sound speed is small, the perturbations can be detected on a proper scale.
This perturbations will change the gravitational potential, thus affecting the geodesic of photons. As a
result, the cosmic microwave background will be changed through the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect. In order to show the differences between UDM mdoel and ΛCDM which corresponds to α = 0,
we give the CMB temperature angular power spectrum in Fig. 7. Our calculations are based on
CAMB [19].


                                  3.     CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL DATA


  Now, we introduce the data set using to constrain the UDM model.


                                  3.1.    Observational Hubble parameter data


  The observational Hubble parameter as a function of redshift has been used to constrain cosmological parameters
[23]. For the observational data, we choose 11 data from [25]. These data were obtained through the measurement of
differential ages of red-envelope galaxies known as ”differential age method”. The aging of stars can be regarded as
an indicator of the aging of the universe. The spectra of stars can be converted to the information of their ages, as
the evolutions of stars are well-known. Since we can not observe stars one by one at cosmological scales, we take the
spectra of galaxies which contain relatively uniform star population. The surveys including the Gemini Deep Deep
Survey [24], VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey and SDSS [25] are related to obtaining data. We consider the red-envelope
galaxies which are massive with fairly homogeneous star population. Moreover, the data can be obtained from the
BAO scale as a standard ruler in the radial direction known as ”Peak Method” [26]. Though this method, we have
three additional data [26]: H(z = 0.24) = 79.69 ± 2.32, H(z = 0.34) = 83.8 ± 2.96, and H(z = 0.43) = 86.45 ± 3.27,
which are independent. Plus the measurement of Hubble constant [27], we totally have 15 data now. The χ2 value of
the H(z) data can be expressed as
                                                           X  [H(zi ) − Hobs (zi )]2
                                               χ2H =                                   ,                                         (9)
                                                           i=1
                                                                         σi2

where σi is the 1σ uncertainty of the observational H(z) data.


                                                    3.2.    Type Ia supernovae


  Since the SNe Ia fist revealed the acceleration of the universe, it has been a well-established method for probing
dark energy.
  Recently, the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) released the Union2 data set including 557 samples [28]. It
covers a redshift region 0-1.4. These data have been widely used to investigate dark energy models [29]. The distance
modules is given by

                                              µtheory (z) = 5 log10 [dL (z)] + µ0 ,                                             (10)

where dL (z) is the luminosity distance. It is defined as
                                                                                          Z z       
                                                                       c            p          dz ′
                            dL (z) = (1 + z)r(z),          r(z) =     p      sinn    |Ωk |             .                        (11)
                                                                                            0 E(z )
                                                                                                   ′

  For CMB, the shift parameters R and la are important indicators which are related to the positions of the CMB
acoustic peaks. These quantities are affected by the cosmic expansion history from the decoupling epoch to today.
The shift parameter R is given by [32]
                                                                         Z z∗      

  The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations we use measure the distance-redshift relation at two redshifts. One is in the
clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples at z = 0.2, the other is in the clustering of the
SDSS luminous red galaxies at z = 0.35. Calculated from these samples, the observed scale of the BAO are analyzed
to constrain the form of the distance scale. The distance scale of BAO is defined as [34]

  The peak positions of the BAO depend on the ratio of Dv (z) to the sound horizon size at the drag epoch. The
redshift zd corresponding to the drag epoch when baryons were released from photos is given by

  The statistics we use to constrain parameters is the usual maximum likelihood method of χ2 fitting with the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Our code is based on CosmoMCMC [38]. The corresponding convergence of
the chains R-1 is set to be less than 0.003 which can guarantee the accuracy well. We combine H(z), SNe Ia, CMB
and BAO data to give a global fitting on determining the parameters of UDM model. The total χ2 is given by

                                               χ2tot = χ2H + χ2SNe + χ2CMB + χ2BAO .                                     (27)

  Fist, we consider a flat universe. In order to embody the H(z) data, we choose three combinations of data
sets and show the 1-D probability distribution of each parameter (Ωb h2 , ΩΛ , α) and 2-D plots for parameters
between each other.        Fitting results from the joint data of H(z)+CMB+BAO are given in Fig 1, the bestvalue for α is α=1.61+3.99     +5.65
                     −4.58 (1σ)−6.92 (2σ)(×10

                                                  ). For comparison, we give the results from SNe+CMB+BAO in
Fig 2. The best-fit value is α=1.81+8.15        +11.99
                                      −8.10 (1σ)−11.69 (2σ)(×10
                                                                −3
                                                                   ). We can see the observational Hubble parameter
data gives a more stringent constraint than SNe Ia in this model. In Fig 3, the total combinations of them result in α=1.72+3.92     +5.47
              −4.79 (1σ)−7.30 (2σ)(×10
                                       −3
                                          ). From the result, the parameter α which stands for the speed of sound
of the unified dark sector seems to be vanishing or slightly larger than 0.                    So ΛCDM model is strongly supported.    We further consider a non-flat universe with curvature.                For H(z)+CMB+BAO in Fig 4, the results

of sound and the curvature are very little. Our results are much more stringent than previous work [14]. Our results
seem to be consistent with α = 0 using the data sets we select. Does that mean there is no need to
introduce a new parameter? We think although the UDM model is contrived, the sound speed of the
unified dark matter is related to the microphysics of the dark component while equation of state does
not. The sound speed leads to the inhomogeneities of dark matter, thus affecting CMB and matter
power spectra. With the development of technique, more information in CMB, matter power spectra
and so on may distinguish UDM model from ΛCDM. Moreover, we assume a constant sound speed,
the whole effective value is very small, however, if when we consider the evolving speed of sound, the
results may be changed.

  In this paper, we constrain the unified dark matter with constant speed of sound from the latest data: the newly

suggest both the speed of sound of the UDM and the curvature are very little and a flat ΛCDM model is still

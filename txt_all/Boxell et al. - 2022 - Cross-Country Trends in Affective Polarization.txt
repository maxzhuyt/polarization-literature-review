                                              ABSTRACT

We measure trends in affective polarization in twelve OECD countries over the past four decades.
According to our baseline estimates, the US experienced the largest increase in polarization over this
period. Five countries experienced a smaller increase in polarization. Six countries experienced a decrease
in polarization. We relate trends in polarization to trends in potential explanatory factors.

1    Introduction

Affective polarization refers to the extent to which citizens feel more negatively toward other political parties than toward their own (Iyengar et al. 2019). Affective polarization has risen substantially in the US in recent decades (Iyengar et al. 2019). In 1978, according to our calculations, the
average partisan rated in-party members 27.4 points higher than out-party members on a “feeling
thermometer” ranging from 0 to 100. In 2020 the difference was 56.3, implying an increase of
1.08 standard deviations as measured in the 1978 distribution. Growing affective polarization may
have important consequences, including reducing the efficacy of government (Hetherington and
Rudolph 2015),1 increasing the homophily of social groups (Iyengar et al. 2012; Iyengar et al.
2019), and altering economic decisions (Gift and Gift 2015; Iyengar et al. 2019).
    Partly due to the difficulty of constructing harmonized data series on partisan affect, there is
limited evidence on long-term trends in affective polarization in developed democracies other than
the US. Cross-country comparisons can help assess why affective polarization has risen in the
US. If affective polarization has risen in countries other than the US, then examining commonalities may suggest promising explanations for the US experience. If affective polarization has not
risen elsewhere, then it may be fruitful to examine factors that help distinguish the US from other
developed democracies.
    In this paper, we present the first cross-country evidence on trends in affective polarization
since the 1980s, focusing on twelve OECD countries. In our baseline analysis, we find that the
US exhibited the largest increase in affective polarization over this period. In five other countries—Switzerland, France, Denmark, Canada, and New Zealand—polarization also rose, but to
a lesser extent. In six other countries—Japan, Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and (West)
Germany—polarization fell.

1 See also Kimball et al.   (2018). Commentators expressing related concerns include Obama (2010), Blankenhorn
 (2015), and Drutman (2017). A 2018 survey shows that more than 70 percent of foreign policy opinion leaders consider political polarization a “critical threat” facing the US, ranking it above issues such as foreign nuclear programs
 (Smeltz et al. 2018).
    To conduct our analysis, we constructed a new database from 149 different surveys, many of
which we harmonized manually. These data permit a first look at cross-country trends in affective polarization since the 1980s, but they also have important limitations. The set of years with
available survey data differs across countries. Question wording and response scales differ across
countries and, in some cases, across survey years for a given country. We include information
about question wording and scale in our plots, analyze the sensitivity of our findings to an alternative transformation of the response scale, and show direct evidence on the sensitivity of measured
affective polarization to survey question wording and response scale. Because the number and
nature of political parties differ across countries and within countries over time, even identically
structured survey questions may take on different meanings in different contexts. We analyze the
sensitivity of our findings to restricting attention to the top two parties in each country and focusing
on periods in which this pair of parties is stable.
    We also assemble data on trends in economic, media, demographic, and political factors that
may be related to affective polarization. Trends in measures of inequality, openness to trade, the
share getting news online, and the fraction foreign-born are either negatively or weakly associated
with trends in affective polarization. Trends in the number of private 24-hour news channels, the
non-white share, partisan sorting, and elite polarization are positively associated with trends in
affective polarization. The association is strongest for the non-white share and elite polarization.
    We are not aware of prior work that situates the rise in affective polarization in the US alongside
trends in as many as eleven other OECD countries over a roughly four-decade span, and studies
the relationship between trends in polarization and trends in potential explanatory factors over that
period. Much previous comparative work on affective polarization has been cross-sectional (e.g.,
Carlin and Love 2018; Westwood et al. 2018; Martini and Torcal 2019) or has relied on data
from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) whose data begin in 1996 (e.g., Reiljan
2020; Gidron et al. 2019a, b, 2020; Harteveld 2021; Ward and Tavits 2019; Wagner 2021).2 There

 marrying across party lines, and find larger increases in displeasure in the US.
is also previous comparative work studying dimensions of mass polarization, such as ideological
polarization, that may have causes and consequences distinct from those of affective polarization
(Iyengar et al. 2019). For example, Draca and Schwarz (2021) analyze data from the World and
European Values Surveys from 1989 through 2010 and find that the US experienced the largest
increase in ideological polarization among the 17 countries considered.3
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data sources and
measure of affective polarization. Section 3 presents our findings on trends in affective polarization. Section 4 presents our findings on the relationship between trends in affective polarization
and trends in potential explanatory factors. Section 5 concludes.


2    Data and Measure of Affective Polarization

Among members of the OECD as of 1973, there are ten, including the US, for which we are aware
of an election study with a partisan affect question prior to 1985. Our sample includes these ten
countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, which we believe make interesting comparisons
to the US. Appendix Figure 10 and Appendix Table 2 provide information on data availability for
all 1973 OECD members, including those we do not include in our sample. We extract a survey
weight associated with each respondent. Appendices A.5 and A.6 detail the survey variables and
data sources for each sample country and included survey year.
    We extract each respondent’s party identification, excluding “leaners” who only choose a party
identification in response to a second prompt. We exclude “leaners” from our sample because not
all surveys include a second prompt.4 Appendix Figure 1 depicts trends in the share of respondents
identifying with a party and the share of affiliates who are affiliated with the top two parties,


3 Some other studies examine long-term trends in mass polarization in individual countries outside the United States,


 including Canada (Kevins and Soroka 2018), Germany (Munzert and Bauer 2013), Britain (Adams et al. 2012a, b),
 and the Netherlands (Adams et al. 2011), but do not report trends in affective polarization.
4 Keith et al. (1992) discuss the interpretation of “leaners.”
separately by country.
    We extract a measure of each respondent’s affect toward the parties in the respondent’s country.
Questions about affect vary across surveys, commonly asking respondents how they feel toward
a given party, how much they like the party, or to what extent they sympathize with the party.5
Numerical response scales also differ across surveys. We apply an affine transformation to the
responses in each survey so that the minimum transformed response is 0 and the maximum transformed response is 100. We refer to the transformed response as the respondent’s reported affect
toward the given party.
    To define affective polarization, fix a given survey and let P denote the set of parties toward
which respondents are asked their affect. Let N denote the set of respondents with non-zero
weight who both provide a valid party identification in P and report a valid affect toward their
own party and at least one other party in P.6 For each respondent i ∈ N , let p (i) ∈ P denote the
party with which the respondent identifies and let Pi ⊆ P denote the set of parties toward which
the respondent reports a valid affect. Let Aip ∈ [0, 100] denote the reported affect of respondent
i toward party p ∈ Pi . Finally, let wi ≥ 0 denote the survey weight of respondent i ∈ N and
let W (P 0 ) = ∑{i∈N :p(i)∈P 0 } wi denote the weighted number of respondents in any set of parties
P 0 ⊆ P, with W (P) denoting the weighted number of respondents in N .
    We define the partisan affect πi of respondent i as

                                               W (p0 )    
                                                             p(i)     p0
                                                                         
                            πi =                           A
                                       ∑ W (Pi) −W (p (i)) i      − A i    .
                                   p0 ∈P \p(i)
                                         i


Partisan affect πi reflects the extent to which respondent i expresses a more favorable attitude
toward her own party than toward other parties.


5 Druckman and Levendusky (2019) study the interpretation of such questions.

6 We iteratively define P and N   after excluding parties with zero affiliates in N from P.
     We define affective polarization Π as the weighted average of respondents’ partisan affect:

                                                        wi
                                             Π= ∑           πi .
                                                  i∈N W (P)

If there are two parties and all respondents state their affect toward both, then affective polarization
Π is the difference between weighted mean own-party affect and weighted mean other-party affect,
as in Iyengar et al. (2019).7 In the multi-party case, our definition is similar to ones adopted by
Gidron et al. (2019b, 2020, equations 1 and 2), Reiljan (2020, equation 3), and Harteveld (2021,
equation 1).8
     We obtain data on various potential explanatory variables at the level of the country and year
from a range of sources that are detailed in Appendix A.7. We try to collect variables that can be
measured reasonably well across different countries and years, and that have been linked in the
literature to the rise in affective polarization. Though not exhaustive, we believe that the variables
we collect reflect many of the important factors that meet these criteria.


3     Comparison of Trends in Affective Polarization

Figure 1 shows the time path of affective polarization in each of the twelve countries that we study.
Plot markers indicate the response scaling in the original survey question. The depicted intervals
constitute a uniform 95 percent confidence band for affective polarization, computed following
Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Møller (2019).
     Each plot depicts an estimated linear time trend and reports its slope. For no country does the

                                               wi   p(i)       wi   P\p(i)
                                     Π= ∑          Ai − ∑          Ai      .

uniform confidence band contain the linear fit, indicating that the linear fit should be taken only as
a convenient summary of the average change, not as a complete description of the dynamics of the
series.9 Each plot also reports the 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the linear trend,
computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Although these intervals and associated p−values
are designed for small-sample settings (using an adjustment from Bell and McCaffrey 2002), we
nevertheless suggest interpreting statements of statistical significance regarding the linear trends
with caution, especially for countries with relatively few survey years.
    Consistent with the existing evidence (e.g., Iyengar et al. 2019), Figure 1 shows that affective
polarization grew rapidly in the US over the sample period. The estimated linear trend is 5.6 points
per decade (p−value < 0.001). For comparison, the standard deviation in partisan affect in the base
period of 1978 was 26.7.
    Five other countries—Switzerland, France, Denmark, Canada, and New Zealand—exhibit a
smaller positive trend. The trend is statistically significant for Denmark. Switzerland’s is the
largest trend of the five, with a slope of 5.1 points per decade (p−value = 0.090). Panel A of Table
1 shows that we can reject the (pairwise) equality of linear trends between the US and each of the
five other countries with a positive trend, except Switzerland.
    The remaining six countries—Japan, Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and Germany—exhibit
a negative linear trend, which is statistically significant for Sweden and Germany. Germany exhibits the largest negative trend, equal to 3.7 points per decade (p−value < 0.001), which can be
compared to a standard deviation in partisan affect in the base period of 1977 of 25.4. Panel A of
Table 1 shows that we can reject the (pairwise) equality of trends between the US and each of the
six countries with a negative linear trend.
    Appendix Figure 2 breaks down the trends in affective polarization into affect toward the respondent’s own party and affect toward other parties. Consistent with an existing literature on


9 Some countries appear to exhibit cyclicality in affective polarization.   In some of these countries (e.g., Britain),
 the surveys we rely on coincide with elections, suggesting that election years themselves are not the source of the
 apparent cyclicality.
negative partisanship (e.g., Abramowitz and Webster 2018), affect towards other parties decreased
at a rate of 6.2 points per decade (p−value < 0.001) in the US, a more negative linear trend than
in any other country in our sample.
   Panel C of Table 1 shows estimated linear trends separately for the periods before and after
2000. After 2000, all countries except Britain and Germany exhibit a positive linear trend, with
the US having the largest estimated trend among all sample countries. We can reject the (pairwise)
equality of post-2000 linear trends between the US and Australia, Norway, and Germany.
   Figure 2 shows the time path of affective polarization when restricting attention to the two
largest parties in each survey round and to a set of surveys with the same two largest parties.
The estimated trend changes sign for Canada and Japan. In this specification Japan exhibits a
large, positive linear trend, more positive than that for the US, though estimated using only three
surveys.
   Our baseline sample excludes “leaners” who provide a party affiliation only when prompted
a second time. Recall that we exclude this group from our main sample because not all surveys
include a second prompt. For those countries where it is feasible, Appendix Figure 3 shows the
time path of affective polarization when including “leaners.” In this exercise, the US remains the
country with the largest linear trend. Appendix Figure 4 shows the time path of affective polarization when assigning party affiliation based on the party toward which the respondent reports the
most positive affect. In this exercise, the US and Switzerland are tied (at reporting precision) for
the largest linear trend.
   Our baseline estimates of affective polarization also depend on an affine transformation of
responses into a common scale. Appendix Figure 5 shows the time path of affective polarization
when we coarsen reported affect to a five-point scale so that surveys do not differ in the fineness
of the affect scale. In this specification the linear trend is more positive for Switzerland than for
the US. Appendix Figure 6 compares the time path of affective polarization in the US measured
from the survey question we use in our main analysis with the time path of affective polarization
measured from an alternative survey question with a different response scale asked in a subset
of survey years. The estimated trends differ by 1.2 points per decade (SE = 0.7), which can be
compared to a baseline trend of 6.4 points per decade. Appendix Figure 7 compares measured
affective polarization between our data sources and those in the CSES.
    Panel B of Table 1 reports the estimated trends and confidence intervals for the sensitivity
analyses in Appendix Figures 3–5.


4   Comparison of Trends in Potential Explanatory Factors

Figure 3 presents evidence on trends in potential explanatory factors. Each panel corresponds to a
different group of variables. Each plot within a panel corresponds to a different variable. Each plot
is a scatterplot where the y-axis is the estimated linear trend in affective polarization, the x-axis
is the estimated linear trend in the explanatory variable, and an observation is a country. Each
plot also reports the Spearman rank correlation between the two trends and the p−value from a
permutation test of the statistical significance of the rank correlation. The line of best fit is also
plotted. Appendix Figure 8 plots the individual series for each of the explanatory variables that we
consider.
    With only twelve countries in our sample, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the
association between trends in affective polarization and trends in explanatory factors, especially
because trends in explanatory variables are correlated across countries. Moreover, our analysis
necessarily includes only a subset of the potentially important factors. Appendix Table 1 reports
the pairwise Spearman rank correlation across the linear trends in the explanatory variables used
in Figure 3, and Appendix Figure 9 presents scatterplots for additional potential explanatory variables.
    Panel A of Figure 3 considers economic and media-related variables. A number of authors
(e.g., Payne 2017; Pearlstein 2018) have linked polarization in the US to growing inequality and
other related economic changes. Similarly, a number of authors (e.g., Lelkes et al. 2017; Sunstein
2017; Settle 2018) have linked polarization in the US to the rise of digital media, and others (e.g.,
Duca and Saving 2017; Martin and Yurukoglu 2017) have linked the growth in polarization to the
rise of partisan cable news networks in the US.10 None of the plots in Panel A of Figure 3 exhibits
a statistically significant rank correlation between the linear trend in the explanatory variable and
the linear trend in affective polarization.
    Panel B of Figure 3 considers demographic and political variables. Many authors (e.g., Mason
2016, 2018; Valentino and Zhirkov 2018; Abramowitz 2018; Mason and Wronski 2018; Westwood
and Peterson 2020) have suggested connections between affective polarization and racial and other
social divisions.11 The linear trend in the share foreign born has a negative and statistically insignificant rank correlation with the linear trend in affective polarization. The linear trend in the
non-white share of the population has a positive rank correlation with the linear trend in affective
polarization, with an associated p−value of 0.052.
    There is also evidence of growing partisan-ideological sorting in the US in recent decades (e.g.,
Fiorina and Abrams 2008; Levendusky 2009; Fiorina 2016, 2017), and this may have influenced
the growth in affective polarization (e.g., Webster and Abramowitz 2017; Lelkes 2018; Orr and
Huber 2020).12 The linear trend in partisan-ideological sorting has a positive and statistically
insignificant rank correlation with the linear trend in affective polarization.
    Elite polarization increased in the US over the period we study (e.g., McCarty et al. 2006)
and changes in elite polarization may influence affective polarization (e.g., Banda and Cluverius
2018).13 The linear trend in elite polarization has a positive and statistically significant rank corre10 But see also, e.g., Arceneaux and Johnson (2013).

12 See Fiorina (2017, chapter 8) for a discussion of cross-country differences in sorting, and see Kevins and Soroka


  (2018) and Adams et al. (2012a) for studies on partisan sorting in Canada and Britain respectively.
13 See also Rehm and Reilly (2010). Elite polarization may of course be influenced by affective polarization as well as


  the reverse. Within the US, some aspects of the growth in elite polarization, such as the realignment of the parties
  in the South following the civil rights era, seem to originate at least in part in the strategic choices of political elites
  rather than the shifting views of voters themselves (Fiorina and Abrams 2008, p. 581; Levendusky 2009, 2010; Lupu
  2015; Banda and Cluverius 2018). Regarding the Southern realignment, see Black and Black (2002), Valentino and
lation with the linear trend in affective polarization (p−value = 0.011)


5      Conclusion

The main contribution of our paper is to situate the rapid rise in affective polarization in the US
over the preceding four decades in an international context. According to our baseline estimates,
the US experienced the most rapid growth in affective polarization over this period among the
twelve OECD countries we consider, with five other countries experiencing smaller increases in
polarization, and six experiencing declines in polarization.
      A secondary contribution of our paper is to examine the relationship between trends in affective
polarization and trends in a set of potential explanatory variables. In some cases (e.g., the nonwhite share of the population and elite polarization), there is evidence of a positive association
between the trend in the explanatory variable and the trend in affective polarization; in other cases
(e.g., inequality, the trade share of GDP, and internet penetration), there is not.
      Our analysis has important limitations. Differences in survey format, political systems, and
other factors make cross-country comparisons of affective polarization challenging. Well-known
limitations of cross-country data (e.g., Mankiw 1995) make it difficult to reach firm conclusions
about the causal role of different explanatory factors. Furthermore, though we have attempted to
measure variables that capture many of the most prominent explanations for the rise in affective
polarization in the US, we have not measured all of them. For example, an existing literature relates
mass polarization to the extent to which a person’s political party is aligned with other aspects of
the person’s identity, such as their race or religion (Mason, 2016, 2018; Mason and Wronski 2018).
Measuring this type of social sorting in a comparable way across countries, and relating trends in
social sorting to the long-term trends in affective polarization that we have documented here, seems
an interesting direction for future work.14

Note: The plot shows our estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. In each plot, one point represents one survey. The red line
displays a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization as the dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable.
Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed following Imbens and
Kolesár (2016). The error bars display a 95% uniform confidence band for affective polarization in the given country, constructed following the
plug-in sup-t method described in Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Møller (2019), under the assumption that estimates are independent across surveys.
These calculations use 1000 simulation draws and estimate the standard error of affective polarization in a given survey as

Note: The plot shows our estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. In each survey, we restrict the
universe of parties P to the two parties p with the largest weighted number of respondents W (p) identifying with that
party. We plot only those surveys in which the set of top two parties coincides with the modal set across all survey
years for the given country. In each plot, one point represents one survey. The red line displays a fitted bivariate linear
regression line with affective polarization as the dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable. Each
plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed
following Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

     Note: Each plot is a scatterplot. The y-axis variable is the estimated linear trend in affective polarization reported in Figure 1. The x-axis variable is the estimated linear trend in the explanatory variable
     reported in Appendix Figure 8, subject to the sample restrictions detailed there. The rank correlation is the Spearman rank correlation between the y-axis and x-axis variables. The rank p-value is for a test
     of the hypothesis that the rank of the linear slope of affective polarization is independent of the rank of the linear slope of the explanatory variable. The test statistic is the Spearman rank correlation and the
     p-value is computed via permutation, except in the case of exact ties in the ranks when we use the AS89 approximation (Best and Roberts 1975). The best fit line is the line of best least-squares fit to the
     scatterplot and is plotted in black. See Appendix Figure 8 for plots of the available data for each country and explanatory variable and Appendix A.7 for additional details on data sources and construction.

     Note: The table reports the estimated slope of a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization Π (as defined in Section 2) as the dependent variable and survey year as the independent
     variable. Adjacent to the slope, the table reports the number of survey years in brackets. Below the estimated slope, the table reports a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope. ‘Baseline’ reports
     estimates from our main specification as in Figure 1. ‘Top two parties’ reports estimates after restricting the universe of parties P to the two parties p with the largest weighted number of respondents
     W (p) identifying with that party and restricting to surveys in which the set of top two parties coincides with the modal set across all years for the given country as in Figure 2. ‘Including leaners’ reports
     estimates after including respondents who only choose a party identification in response to a second survey prompt and restricting to countries that have such a survey in at least two years as in Appendix
     Figure 3. ‘Favorite party’ reports estimates after assuming each respondent i is affiliated to the party p toward which the respondent expresses the most positive affect Aip , breaking ties at random, as in
     Appendix Figure 4. ‘Coarsening’ reports estimates after coarsening reported affect Aip to a five-point scale by rounding to the nearest multiple of 25 as in Appendix Figure 5. ‘Pre-2000’ and ‘Post-2000’
     are the respective estimated linear trends when we impose a linear spline with a knot at 2000. The last two rows of Panel A report the p-values from tests of whether the slope for a given country is equal
     to the slope in the US and zero, respectively. The penultimate two rows of Panel C report the p-values from tests of whether the post-2000 slope for a given country is equal to the post-2000 slope in the
     US and zero, respectively, and the last row of Panel C reports the p-value from a test of whether the pre-2000 and post-2000 slopes are the same in a given country. Confidence intervals and p-values are
     computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Panel D reports the weighted standard deviation of partisan affect πi in the first survey year for each respective country.

Note: Panel A shows the weighted number of affiliates expressed as a share of the weighted number of respondents.
Panel B shows the weighted number of respondents affiliated with the top two parties, expressed as a share of the
weighted number of affiliates. In both panels, the weighted number of affiliates is the weighted number of respondents
who state an affiliation to a party about which an affect question is asked in at least one survey for the given country.
In Panel B, distinct shapes are used to indicate sets of survey years for which the top two parties are the same.

Note: The plot decomposes affective polarization Π into own-party affect (black circles) and other-party affect (red triangles). Following the

Thus, affective polarization Π is equal to the difference between own-party affect and other-party affect. In each plot, one point represents one
survey. The solid lines display fitted bivariate linear regression lines with affect as the dependent variable and survey year as the independent
variable. Each plot reports the estimated slopes (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals computed following
Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

Note: The plot shows estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. In contrast to our baseline
estimates, we include leaners in the sample. Leaners are respondents who only choose a party identification
in response to a second survey prompt. We include only surveys that have a second prompt, and only
countries that have such a survey in at least two years. In each plot, one point represents one survey. The
red line displays a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization as the dependent variable
and survey year as the independent variable. Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the
corresponding 95 percent confidence interval following Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

Note: The plot shows estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. In contrast to our baseline
estimates, we assume that each respondent i is affiliated to the party p toward which the respondent expresses
the most positive affect Aip , breaking ties at random. In each plot, one point represents one survey. The red
line displays a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization as the dependent variable and
survey year as the independent variable. Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the
corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

Note: The plot shows estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. In contrast to our baseline
estimates, we coarsen reported affect Aip to a five-point scale by rounding to the nearest multiple of 25. In
each plot, one point represents one survey. The red line displays a fitted bivariate linear regression line
with affective polarization as the dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable. Each plot
reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed
following Imbens and Kolesár (2016).

Note: The plot shows estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2 across two different
series constructed from the ANES survey conducted in the US. The black line with circle markers uses the
main ANES feeling thermometer asked in the pre-election wave of the study and which we use in our main
estimates in Figure 1. The red line with triangle markers uses the post-election CSES module in the ANES
survey that uses a 0-10 scale and alternative question wording. For example, in 2004, the CSES module
asked, “I’d like to know what you think about each of our political parties. After I read the name of a
political party, please rate it on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that party and 10
means that you strongly like that party. If I come to a party you haven’t heard of or you feel you do not know
enough about, just say so.” Party affiliation is defined using the main ANES pre-election party identification
variable. We use survey weights and restrict the sample to respondents with non-missing affect for both
series. We use the 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Time Series versions of the ANES data for this figure.
Each line displays a bivariate linear regression line, fit to the respective series, with affective polarization as
the dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable. The difference between the two slopes
is reported in grey to the left of the two series, with standard error calculated via a nonparametric bootstrap
with 500 replicates, stratified by survey year.

Note: The plot shows our estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2 for our main series as well as for data from the Comparative
Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). In some cases, our main series uses the CSES data directly: Switzerland (2003), France (post-2000), and Japan
(post-1990). In other cases, our main data provider and the CSES are often collaborators using the same sample of respondents. In each plot, one
point represents one survey. We normalize the level of the CSES series so that the first CSES survey aligns with the level of the corresponding (or
preceeding) year in our main series. The CSES series is shifted left by 1/3 years for ease of visualization, and we restrict the CSES data to West
Germany for consistency with our main series.

Note: Countries are sorted from left to right in descending order of the estimated linear time trend of affective polarization. Panel A plots the measure of affective
polarization along with the estimated linear time trend for each country; Panel B plots the trade share of GDP in each country; Panel C plots the Gini coefficient for
each country; and Panel D plots the share of households with internet access in each country. See Appendix A.7 for additional details on data sources and construction.
Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Plots
with an asterisk after the country name indicate the countries excluded from the computations in Figure 3 for each respective variable.

Note: Countries are sorted from left to right in descending order of the estimated linear time trend of affective polarization. Panel A plots the measure of affective
polarization along with the estimated linear time trend for each country; Panel E plots the share of respondents getting news online; Panel F plots the reach of the
largest private 24-hour TV news network in each country; and Panel G plots the number of 24-hour TV news networks indicated in the Reuters Institute Digital News
Report 2020. See Appendix A.7 for additional details on data sources and construction. Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding
95 percent confidence interval computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Plots with an asterisk after the country name indicate the countries excluded from the
computations in Figure 3 for each respective variable.

Note: Countries are sorted from left to right in descending order of the estimated linear time trend of affective polarization. Panel A plots the measure of affective
polarization along with the estimated linear time trend for each country; Panel H plots the share of foreign born individuals in each country; Panel I plots the proportion
of the population that is non-white in each country; and Panel J plots the degree of ethnic fractionalization in each country. See Appendix A.7 for additional details
on data sources and construction. Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed following
Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Plots with an asterisk after the country name indicate the countries excluded from the computations in Figure 3 for each respective

partisan-ideological sorting in each country; and Panel M plots the degree of elite polarization as rated by experts in each country. See Appendix A.7 for additional
details on data sources and construction. Each plot reports the estimated slope (change per year) and the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval computed
following Imbens and Kolesár (2016). Plots with an asterisk after the country name indicate the countries excluded from the computations in Figure 3 for each
respective variable.

Note: Each plot is a scatterplot. The y-axis variable is the estimated linear trend in affective polarization reported in Figure 1. The x-axis variable
is the estimated linear trend in the explanatory variable reported in Appendix Figure 8, subject to the sample restrictions detailed there. The rank
correlation is the Spearman rank correlation between the y-axis and x-axis variables. The rank p-value is for a test of the hypothesis that the rank of
the linear slope of affective polarization is independent of the rank of the linear slope of the explanatory variable. The test statistic is the Spearman
rank correlation and the p-value is computed via permutation, except in the case of exact ties in the ranks when we use the AS89 approximation
(Best and Roberts 1975). The best fit line is the line of best least-squares fit to the scatterplot and is plotted in black. See Appendix Figure 8 for
plots of the available data for each country and explanatory variable and Appendix A.7 for additional details on data sources and construction.

A.5     Survey Variables

We use three main survey variables in this study: partisan affect questions, party affiliation questions, and survey weights.
     For partisan affect questions, we report the question wordings below, with the assigned question
wording category in parentheses after the year. Survey years with similar wording are grouped
together and a single example is given. In some surveys, regional parties are included only for
those respondents in the relevant region.
     For party affiliation questions, we do not detail the question wordings below. We use questions
that ask, for example, “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a
Democrat, an Independent, or what?,” which is taken from the American National Election Study,
or “Which party do you feel closest to?,” which is taken from the 1997 Norwegian Election Survey.
The exact language varies across countries and across surveys for a given country. As with the
partisan affect questions, in some surveys, regional parties are included only for those respondents
in the relevant region. Throughout, we attempt to restrict the sample to respondents for which party
affiliate questions were asked.
     For survey weights, we report below a description of our choice of weight for each country.
In choosing the survey weights, we tried to obtain the largest nationally representative sample,
sometimes compromising in order to maintain consistency across years.

A.5.1    CSES

Surveys were conducted in dozens of different languages, usually the most common language in a
particular country. We cite the official English translations here.

   • Modules 1–5 (like): I’d like to know what you think about each of our political parties. After
     I read the name of a political party, please rate it on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you
     strongly dislike that party and 10 means that you strongly like that party. If I come to a party
     you haven’t heard of or you feel you do not know enough about, just say so.

Each survey included a sample weight, a demographic weight, a political weight, a combination
of the three, or none. In choosing weights for a given country, we balanced preferences for consistency across years in the CSES data and consistency with our choice of weights for the non-CSES
data source for the respective country.
    See the CSES codebooks for a detailed discussion of deviations across country election studies
in party affiliation, affect, and weight variables.
A.5.2   Australia

We exclude online survey respondents from 2001. Surveys were conducted in English. Partisan
affect questions are as follows.
   • 1993 (favourable): Finally in this section, we would like to know your feelings about the
     political parties. Please show how you feel about them by circling a number from 0 to 10.
     10 is the highest rating, if you feel very favourable about a party, and 0 is the lowest rating,
     for parties you feel very unfavourable about. If you are neutral about a particular party or
     don’t know much about them, you should give them a rating of 5.

   • 1996/1998/2001/2004/2007/2010/2013/2016/2019 (like): Finally in this section, we would
     like to know what you think about each of our political parties. Please rate each party on
     a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that party and 10 means that you
     strongly like that party. If you are neutral about a particular party or don’t know much about
     them, you should give them a rating of 5.
For the 1993, 2010, and 2013 surveys, there is a single choice of weight variable. For the 2016
and the 2019 surveys, there are multiple weight options, and we choose the weight variables that
account for data from all sampling approaches. All other surveys are self-weighting.

A.5.3   Britain

Surveys were conducted in English. Partisan affect questions are as follows.
   • 1979 (like): Let’s say that you gave each of the parties a mark out of ten points—a mark
     according to how much or how little you like it. You can give each party any mark from 0
     out of 10 for the least like, to 10 out of 10 for the most liked. What mark out of 10 would
     you give the [Insert Party Name]?

   • 1987/1992 (favour-against): Please choose a phrase from this card to say how you feel about
     the      Party? (Strongly in favor, In favor, Neither in favour/nor against, Against, Strongly
     against, DK/Can’t say)

   • 1997/2001/2005/2010/2015 (like): I’m now going to ask a few questions about political
     parties. On a scale that runs from 0 to 10, where 0 means strongly dislike and 10 means
     strongly like, how do you feel about the    Party?
The 1979 survey is self-weighting. For 1987 and 1992, there is a single weight variable that
weights respondents by region. There are multiple weight variables for all other surveys, and we
attempt to select a weight variable for each survey that is similar to the weight variables used in
earlier surveys.
A.5.4   Canada

Surveys were conducted in English and French. We cite the English questions here. Partisan affect
questions are as follows.

   • 1968 (like): You’ll see here a drawing of a thermometer. It’s been called a feeling thermometer because it helps measure one’s feelings towards various things. Here’s how it works. If
     you don’t particularly like or dislike the person, group or activity we are asking about, place
     them at the 50 degree mark. If your feelings are very warm then you would give a score
     between 50 and 100, the warmer your feelings, the higher the score. On the other hand, if
     you do not like the person, group or activity very much, you would place them somewhere
     between 0 and 50. The cooler your feelings, the closer the number will be to 0. If you don’t
     know too much about one of the items mentioned, just say so, and we’ll go on to the next
     one ... How would you rate the       party, taken as a whole?

   • 1974 (warm): You will see here a drawing of a thermometer. It is called a feeling thermometer because it helps us measure people’s feelings towards various things. Here is how
     it works. If you don’t have any particular feeling about the things we are asking about, place
     the thermometer at the 50-degree mark. If your feelings are very warm toward a particular
     thing, you would give a score between 50 and 100, the warmer your feelings, the higher the
     score. On the other hand, if your feelings are relatively cool toward something, you would
     place the thermometer between 0 and 50. The cooler your feelings, the closer the score will
     be to zero. If you don’t know too much about any of these items mentioned, just say so and
     we will go on to the next one... How would you rate the       party, taken as a whole?

   • 1988/1993 (favourable): Now let’s talk about your feelings towards the political parties, their
     leaders and their candidates. I’ll read a name and ask you to rate a person or a party on a
     thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 degrees. Ratings between 50 and 100 degrees mean
     that you feel favourable toward that person. Ratings between 0 and 50 degrees mean that
     you feel unfavourable toward that person. You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell me
     how you feel. How would you rate the         Party?

        – 1993 clarifies “federal     Party”

   • 1997/2000/2004/2008/2011/2015/2019 (like): Now the political parties. On the same scale,
     where zero means you really dislike the party and one hundred means you really like the
     party. How do you feel about the federal   party?

For all surveys, we choose the weight variable that provides a nationally representative weight
for all respondents when options are available. For the 1974 survey, we use a weight based on
province. For the 1988, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011, and 2015 surveys, we use a weight
based on province and household demographics. For the 2019 survey, we use a weight based on
province and phone type.

A.5.5   Denmark

Surveys were conducted in Danish. We cite the English translations provided to us by Rune
Stubager here for the examples in each group.

   • 1971/1973/1975/1977/1979 (like): I have a card with a kind of thermometer called a ‘sympathy thermometer’, and we will ask you to give the parties’ temperatures according to how
     much you like them. Give plus temperatures to all of the parties you like – the more you
     like a party, the higher the temperature. The parties you don’t like get minus temperatures.
     If you neither like nor dislike a party, give it a 0.

   • 1994 (like): Here are some questions about how much you like the parties, party leaders, and
     the policy which the parties have pursued. Even though you may view a party, its leader and
     policy as a whole, we ask you to try and answer each question. Beginning with the leaders,
     here is a card with a scale running from 0 to 10. The more you like the person, the higher
     mark you give. If you neither like nor dislike a person, you should give 5.

   • 1998/2001/2005/2007/2011/2015 (like): Now I would like to hear what you think of the
     political parties. After I have mentioned the party, I want you to place it on this scale from
     0 to 10, where 0 means you that dislike the party were much and 10 means that you like it
     were much. If I mention a party that you don’t know or don’t feel you know enough about,
     just say so.

We exclude the 2019 Danish Election Study (available at http://bank1.surveybank.aau.dk/webview/)
because the survey only asks whether respondents identify with a party without following up to
determine the party the respondent identifies with. For 1971 and 1973 there are no weights. For
1975 and 1994, since it is not clear how the given weights are constructed, we do not use them.
For 1977, the survey administrators imputed non-responses with responses from respondents who
possessed similar demographic features; we are unaware of a way to detect these imputations and
do not attempt to remove them. There is also a political weight for 1977, which we did not use
because we are only using demographic weights. For the remaining years, for consistency, we only
use those weights that take into account measures associated with geography (such as county or
region), gender, and age—with the exception of 1998 (which also takes into account the number
of adults in the household) and 1979 (which also takes into account the level of urbanization).
A.5.6   France

Surveys were conducted in French. We cite the provided English translation for the 1967 survey,
while we cite our own translation for the 1988 survey.

   • 1967 (close-negative feelings): There are groups and individuals who influence government
     and public opinion. We would like to know your feelings in respect to them. Would you put
     a figure between 0 and 100 by these persons or groups according to the feelings which you
     have for them. 100 = close feelings. 50 = neither for nor against. 0 = negative feelings.

         – In the raw data provided, responses between 0 and 2 were coded as 2 and responses between 97 and 100 were coded as 97. We recode these values to 0 and 100 respectively.
         – We grouped the parties “UNR (nothing more precise)” and “UNR - leftist; Gaullists of
           the left; UDT”, which had 353 and 4 affiliates respectively, together.

   • 1988 (sympathy): I would now like to know your personal feeling on political parties and
     the main candidates for the private election. Using this scale, do you want to put a score
     from 0 to 100 to the people or groups that I will name you in depending on your sympathy
     for them. -100 means you have a lot of sympathy - 0 means you don’t like it at all - 50 means
     you have neither sympathy nor antipathy or that you don’t know much of them. What grade
     would you give to:

   • 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017: We use data from the CSES. See the CSES question wording.

There is a single choice of weight variable for 1967. No weight variables were provided for 1988.

A.5.7   (West) Germany

We drop observations in some months of 1982, 1987 and 1988 where multiple versions of the
questionnaire were used (see variable v79 in the data outlining these observations). We drop duplicate respondents. We restrict attention to West Germany (see variable V4a), except for the years
1996–1998 when the surveys were not separately conducted between the two regions. In Appendix Figure 11 below, we compare trends in East versus West Germany, excluding 1996–1998
when these regions are not distinguished.
              Appendix Figure 11: Trends in Affective Polarization—East vs. West Germany

                                                                     Germany

                                                                                                  (−0.31,−0.12)
                                                     Slope: −0.37
                                                     (−0.43,−0.31)

Note: The plot shows estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2 across two different series
constructed from the Politbaroameter survey conducted in the Germany. One point represents one survey.
The red line with triangle markers uses data from West Germany. The black line with the circle markers uses
data from East Germany. Each line is a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization as
the dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable. The estimated slopes (change per year)
and the corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals, computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016), are
also reported. We exclude data from 1996–1998 for both series because the surveys do not distinguish East
and West Germany in these years.


Surveys were conducted in German. We translate the question ourselves. Partisan affect questions
are as follows.

    • All years (think highly): Imagine a thermometer that goes from +5 to -5 with a 0 point in
      between. With this thermometer, tell me what you think of the individual parties. +5 means
      that you think highly of the party. -5 means you don’t think anything of it at all. With the
      values in between, you can give your opinion in stages.

There is a single choice of weight variable for all years.

A.5.8   Japan

Surveys were conducted in Japanese. We cite the official English translation here. Partisan affect
questions are as follows.

    • 1967 (like): Now I am going to ask you whether you like or dislike political parties. How
      much do you like    ?
          – Like = 1, Like a Little = 2, Depends = 3, Dislike a Little = 4, Dislike = 5

   • 1976 (like): People have all kinds of feelings toward the people and groups which are influential in politics. In answering the following questions, if you don’t like or dislike a person
     or group would you indicate this by giving them a rating of 50 degrees? If you like the person or group would you give them a rating between 50 and 100 degrees, and if you dislike
     them a rating between 0 and 50 degrees?

   • 1996, 2004, 2007, 2013: We use data from the CSES. See the CSES question wording.
There is either a single choice of weight or no weight in 1967 and 1976. For weight choices in
latter years, see CSES.

A.5.9    New Zealand

Surveys were conducted in English and Maori. We cite the English questions here. Partisan affect
questions are as follows.
   • 1990/1993 (support-oppose): Regardless of what their chances were in winning your particular electorate, or even winning any seats at all, how do you feel about these political parties?
     (Strongly Support = 1, Support = 2, Neutral = 3, Oppose = 4, Strongly Oppose = 5 )

   • 1996/1999/2002/2005/2008/2011/2014/2017 (like): We would like to know what you think
     about each of these political parties. Please rate each party on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0
     means you strongly dislike that party and 10 means that you strongly like that party. If you
     haven’t heard about that party or don’t know enough about it, please circle ‘99’ under ‘don’t
     know’. How do you feel about: [Insert Party Name]
For all surveys, we use weights associated with validated voters only for consistency across surveys. Weights for non-validated voters are not reported in the surveys between 2008 and 2017.

A.5.10    Norway

Surveys were conducted in Norwegian. We cite the official English translation here. Partisan affect
questions are as follows.
   • 1981/1985/1989/1993 (like): We want to know how much or little you like the different
     parties. On this card is a scale that we call “sympathy thermometer.” At 50-degrees-line
     position the parties that you neither like or dislike. A party that you like to have a location
     from 50 to 100 degrees. The better you like the party, the higher position. However, if it is a
     party you do not like, it should be placed between 0 and 50 degrees, with 0 as the expression
     of at least sympathy.
   • 1997/2001/2005/2009/2013/2017 (like): After I read the name of a political party, please
     rate it on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that party and 10 means
     that you strongly like that party.
All surveys except 2013 and 2017 are self-weighting. For the 2013 survey, we use the weight
variable that includes mail-in respondents. For the 2017 survey, we use the post-stratified weight
variable based on gender, education, and age.

A.5.11   Sweden

Surveys were conducted in Swedish. We cite the official English translation here. Partisan affect
questions are as follows.
   • All Years (like): On this card there is a kind of scale. I would like you to use it in order to
     state how much you like or dislike the parties. If you like a party, use the “plus” figures. The
     better you like a party the higher the “plus” figure. For parties you dislike, use the “minus”
     figures. The more you dislike a party, the higher the “minus” figure. The zero point on the
     scale indicates that you neither like nor dislike a party. Where would you like to place the
        ? (Ranges from -5 to 5.)
All surveys are self-weighting.

A.5.12   Switzerland

Surveys were conducted in German, French and Italian. We translate the questions ourselves.
Partisan affect questions are as follows.
   • 1975 (like): Here is a scale we call a favorability thermometer. Please give a score between
     0 and 100 indicating how much you like the following groups and organizations. 100 means
     that you like them very much, 0 means that you do not like them at all. If you don’t particularly like or dislike them... give a score of 50. What score would you give to [Insert Party
     Name]?

   • 1995/1999 (sympathy): Now I would like to know what you think of our political parties.
     When I read the name of a political party to you, please indicate where you place it on a scale
     from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning “no sympathy at all”, and 10 meaning “a lot of sympathy”.

   • 2003: We use data from the CSES. See the CSES question wording.

   • 2007 (like): We would now like to know what you think of some of the political parties.
     Please place the         on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 means that you do not like this party at
     all. 10 means you like this party very much.
    • 2011 (sympathy): Could you indicate, on a scale of 0 to 10, how much sympathy you feel
      for the following parties.

The documentation states that “In 1975, the scale was originally from 0 to 100, but 0 was later
recoded wrongly to . (no value) and then to -1, so we don’t know which -1 are originally 0’s and
which are really missings.” In the main analysis, we treat the 1975 coding as-is. In Appendix
Figure 12 below, we instead replace all out-party missing or -1 codings with 0 for the affect score
and leave in-party affect scores as-is for the four parties for which affect questions were asked.

Note: The plot shows our estimates of affective polarization Π as defined in Section 2. One point represents
one survey. The red line displays a fitted bivariate linear regression line with affective polarization as the
dependent variable and survey year as the independent variable. The estimated slope (change per year) and
the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval, computed following Imbens and Kolesár (2016), are also
reported. For the data in 1975, we replace all out-party missing or -1 codings with zero for the four affect
questions asked. We leave all in-party responses to the affect questions as-is.


For all surveys, we use the weight variable that weights respondents by canton, turnout, and party
choice.

A.5.13    US

Surveys were conducted in English. Spanish and French translations did occur. We cite the English
question here. Partisan affect questions are as follows.

    • All Years (favorable and warm): We’d also like to get your feelings about some groups in
      American society. When I read the name of a group, we’d like you to rate it with what
      we call a feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees-100 degrees mean that you feel
      favorably and warm toward the group; ratings between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don’t
      feel favorably towards the group and that you don’t care too much for that group. If you
      don’t feel particularly warm or cold toward a group you would rate them at 50 degrees. If
      we come to a group you don’t know much about, just tell me and we’ll move on to the next
      one.

          – In the raw data provided for 2016 and earlier, responses between 97 and 100 were
            coded as 97. We recode this response to 100. The data for 2020 was not top coded.

In the main analysis, we include all interview modes. Some respondents in 2012, 2016, and 2020
were interviewed via the web. In Appendix Figure 13 below, we exclude those respondents interviewed via the web and restrict the data to respondents interviewed face-to-face, over video, and
over telephone.

A.7   Data Sources for Potential Explanatory Variables

See Appendix Figure 8 for plots of the available data for each country and variable.

   • Inequality (Gini): Gini coefficient from Roser and Ortiz-Ospina (2013) and Gini Index
     (World Bank estimate) from the World Bank (2020a). For each country, we use the data
     series that covers more years, and report in Appendix Table 3 the correlation between the
     two series for overlapping years.

   • Trade Share of GDP: Trade (percent of GDP) from the World Bank (2020b). Defined to
     be the the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross
     domestic product.

   • Internet Penetration: Individuals using the internet (percent of population) from the World
     Bank (2020c). Defined to be individuals (percent of population) who have used the Internet
     (from any location) in the last 3 months.

   • Share Getting News Online: Share of respondents in the Reuters Institute Digital News
     Report 2020 survey (Newman et al. 2020) who reported getting news online (including
     social media) in the last week. We assume the 1995 value for each country is 0.

   • Priv. 24-hr TV News (Share): Share of respondents in the Reuters Institute Digital News
     Report 2020 survey (Newman et al. 2020) who reported watching the largest private 24hour TV news network in the last week. We assume the value for each country was zero in
     1980, the launch year of CNN (the first 24-hr private news network).

   • Priv. 24-hr TV News (Count): The number of private 24-hour TV news networks in the
     Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2020 survey (Newman et al. 2020). We assume the
     value for each country was zero in 1980, the launch year of CNN (the first 24-hr private news
     network).

   • Foreign-born Share: We impute the share of foreign-born population using stocks of foreignborn population from OECD (2020), total international migrant stock from the World Bank
     (2020d), and total population from the World Bank (2020e). To complement our primary
     source, we obtain foreign-born population (percent of population) from OECD (2019). For
     each country, we rescale the data from OECD (2019) by adding a scalar constant such that
     the two series are equal on average for overlapping years. We use the non-OECD (2019)
     data for overlapping country-years.
    • Non-white Share: Uses data from Drazanova (2020).24 In general, the classification of
      race/ethnicity/nationality varies across countries and can vary over time, including which
      groups are included in an “other” category. When shares do not sum to one (e.g., survey or
      census respondents may self-classify into multiple categories or rounding errors), we renormalize the shares to sum to one by dividing by their unnormalized sum. We classify groups
      as “white” if they are labeled as such or are of European heritage (including Turkish).

    • Ethnic Fractionalization: Ethnic fractionalization (scaled by 100) computed using data from
      Drazanova (2020) and following the equation for “FRAC” in Montalvo and Reynal-Querol
      (2005, p. 798).

    • Ethnic Polarization: Ethnic polarization (scaled by 100) computed using data from Drazanova
      (2020) and following the equation for “RQ” in Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005, p. 798).

    • Partisan-ideological Sorting: The R2 from a weighted regression of respondent’s self-reported
      ideology (numeric liberal-conservative scale) on party affiliation indicators using the data in
      our main series and the set of parties used in Panel A of Appendix Figure 1 (see Kevins and
      Soroka 2018). For Japan, we only use our CSES-derived series and supplement with data
      from the World Values Survey (Inglehart et al. 2014). The liberal-conservative scale varies
      across and within countries.

    • Elite Polarization: The measure of adjusted elite polarization, as rated by experts, reported
      in Rehm and Reilly (2010), scaled by 100.

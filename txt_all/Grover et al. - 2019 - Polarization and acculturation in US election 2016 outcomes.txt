Keywords:                                             Elections are among the most critical events in a national calendar. During elections, candidates increasingly use

  Twitter analytics methods

  Descriptive analytics
  • Retweet (Bode et al., 2015; Yardi and Boyd, 2010)                          Allows one follower to share someone else's tweet.
  • URL analysis (Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan, 2013a, 2013b)                       Allows users to disseminate information by including the URL within the 140 character tweet.
  • Hashtags analysis (Bode et al., 2015; Borondo et al., 2014; Chae, 2015)    Hashtags are user-generated keywords preceded by the # symbol, allowing users to cluster opinions.
  • @mentions analysis (Borondo et al., 2014; Larsson and Ihlen, 2015; Shuai   @mentions allow users to draw an individual's attention to a discussion topic (and helps in
      et al., 2012)                                                            promoting one to one discussions on Twitter).
  • Word cloud (Nooralahzadeh et al., 2013)                                    Pictorially represents the most frequent words used in Twitter discussions.
  • Reach metric (Ganis and Kohirkar, 2015)                                    Measures the reach of the tweets.

  Content analysis
  • Sentiment analysis (Burnap et al., 2015)                                   Identiﬁes and categorizes opinions present the text.
     I. Polarity analysis                                                      Categorizes user opinions in the text into positive, negative, and neutral.
     II. Emotion analysis                                                      Categorize the tweets on the basis of the emotions expressed.
  • Topic modelling (Llewellyn et al., 2015)                                   Identiﬁes the key themes within the text.

  Network analysis
  • Network analysis (HerdaĞdelen et al., 2013; Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan,       Depict connection among the users
       2013a, 2013b)
  • Cluster/community detection (Abascal-Mena et al., 2015)                    Identiﬁes diﬀerent communities among users.
  • Information ﬂow networks (Park et al., 2015)                               Depicts the ﬂow of the information across a network.

  GeoSpatial analysis
  • Time-trend analysis (Saboo et al., 2016)                                   Temporal analysis of trends or topics.
  • Geospatial analysis (Attu and Terras, 2017; Stephens and Poorthuis,        Location speciﬁc analysis

    Content analysis is used to extract the semantic content from text
data. It uses principles from natural language processing (NLP) and text
mining (Kayser and Blind, 2017) in order to retrieve information from a
large amount of text data (Kassarjian, 1977). For example, sentiment
analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing
opinions present in the text (Zhang et al., 2016). It consists of two
analytical components: polarity analysis and emotion analysis. For this
study, sentiment analysis of the tweets was performed with R (programming language), using syuzhet, lubridate, and dplyr libraries. Polarity analysis is one of the most commonly used techniques for analyzing Twitter data; classifying the opinions of the users in terms of
positive, negative, and neutral. Emotion analysis is a technique in
which user-generated content is classiﬁed into eight emotions, namely
anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.

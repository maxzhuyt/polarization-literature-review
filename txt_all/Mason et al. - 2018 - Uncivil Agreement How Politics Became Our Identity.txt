                       Figure 3.1. Traditional measure of ideology
Note: Data drawn from the American National Election Studies cumulative file 1948– 2008
(fully weighted) and the 2012 file (fully weighted). Ideology item available from 1972 and
   later. Democrats and Republicans include independents who lean toward one party.
                             Figure 3.2. Identity-based ideology
 Note: Data drawn from the American National Election Studies from 1972, 1992, and 2000.
 Democrats and Republicans include independents who lean toward one party. Vertical axis
represents the percentage of Democrats/Republicans who identify with liberals/conservatives,
                                         respectively.
  Figure 3.3. Difference between the average policy positions of Democrats and Republicans
  Note: Data drawn from the American National Election Studies cumulative file 1948–2008
(fully weighted) and the 2012 ANES file (fully weighted). Democrats and Republicans include
 independents who lean toward one party. Values represent the difference between the mean
Democratic and mean Republican position on each issue. Bars to the left of zero indicate that
              Democrats and Republicans differ in a party-inconsistent direction.
Figure 3.3. (continued)
                                Figure 3.4. Social-group sorting
      Note: Bars represent the difference between the percentage of group members in the
  Republican Party and the percentage of group members in the Democratic Party (including
 partisan leaners). Income percentile is the difference between the mean income percentile of
Republicans and Democrats. Data are drawn from the ANES cumulative data file for the 1952,
1972, and 1992 graphs (fully weighted) and from the 2012 ANES (fully weighted) for the 2012
 graph. There is also a gender gap between the parties, but this does not follow a clear pattern
over time. Though Democrats were slightly more male (by 3 points) in 1952, Republicans have
 been consistently more male ever since, with a partisan gap of 4 points in 1972, 10 points in
                                   1992, and 7 points in 2012.
                            Figure 3.5. Identity-based social sorting
Note: Bars represent the difference between the percentage of Republicans who claimed to feel
identified with each group minus the percentage of Democrats who did so (including partisan
           leaners). Data drawn from the ANES data files of 1972, 1992, and 2000.
                    Figure 4.1. Warmth bias and policy extremity over time
     Note: Warmth bias is the absolute difference between each respondent’s thermometer
   rating of the Democratic and Republican parties. Policy extremity is an index of six issues
including abortion policy, government services versus spending, government health insurance,
  government aid to minorities, government employment protections, and defense spending.
  Each issue is folded in half so that higher scores represent more extreme positions on both
  ends of the spectrum. The six folded issue scales are then combined into an index. Data are
 drawn from the ANES cumulative file through 2012 (fully weighted), using only observations
                        for which answers are available for all six issues.
              Figure 4.2. Predicted feelings of warmth toward the Democratic Party
   Note: Data drawn from the ANES cumulative file (fully weighted) and the ANES 2012 file
(fully weighted). Predicted values are derived from OLS regressions, controlling for education,
     sex, race, age, southern residence, urban residence, and church attendance. For the full
                                regressions, see appendix table A.1a.
              Figure 4.3. Predicted feelings of warmth toward the Republican Party
   Note: Data drawn from the ANES cumulative file (fully weighted) and the ANES 2012 file
(fully weighted). Predicted values are derived from OLS regressions, controlling for education,
     sex, race, age, southern residence, urban residence, and church attendance. For the full
                               regressions, see appendix table A.1b.
               Figure 4.4. Social distance between Democrats and Republicans
 Note: Data are drawn from an adult sample collected by YouGov Polimetrix, using funding
  from the National Science Foundation under grant no. SES-1065054. Bars represent mean
 levels of reported willingness among self-identified Democrats and Republicans, including
independent leaners. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals around mean values shown to
                                indicate significant differences.
  Figure 4.5. Predicted difference in social distance between ingroup and outgroup partisans
    Note: Predicted values drawn from an OLS regression controlling for education, political
 knowledge, race, gender, income, age, and church attendance. Ninety-five percent confidence
   intervals shown. Originating regressions are shown in appendix table A.2. Data are drawn
from the 2011 Polimetrix sample. Sample includes only those respondents who have indicated
  preference for one party (N = 774). Partisanship is a scale introduced and tested by Huddy,
 Mason, and Aarøe (2015), based on items often found in social-psychological identity scales
(Luhtanen and Crocker 1992; Crocker et al. 1994). Issues are an index of five generally salient
  political issues, weighted by the rated importance of each one, as well as a measure of issue
constraint. Social-distance scale ranges from 0 (no difference in willingness to interact socially
 with members of the two parties) to 1 (maximal difference in willingness to interact socially
                                with members of the two parties).

Regression Model Predicting Social-Distance Bias
Figure 5.1. Predicted values of partisan prejudice (warmth bias) among strong partisans across
                                         levels of sorting
  Note: Bars represent predicted values of warmth bias at varying levels of partisan-ideological
   sorting in the ANES models and social sorting in the YouGov model, controlling for issue
extremity and constraint, political knowledge, education, race, gender, income, age, and church
   attendance. Originating regressions are shown in appendix table A.4. Ninety-five percent
 confidence intervals are shown. ANES samples are fully weighted. The low sorting score in the
 ANES models is not zero but 0.0857, the lowest sorting score possible given a strong partisan
  identity. In the YouGov sample, the lowest possible value of the social-sorting scale among
           strong partisans is 0.4286, and this is therefore the low sorting value used.
Figure 5.2. Predicted values of partisan prejudice (warmth bias) among strong partisans across
                              levels of sorting and issue polarization
 Note: Bars represent predicted values of warmth bias at varying levels of social sorting in the
  YouGov 2011 sample, across three levels of issue extremity, controlling for issue constraint,
political knowledge, education, race, gender, income, age, and church attendance. Originating
regression is shown in appendix table A.5. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are shown.
  The lowest observed value of the social-sorting scale among strong partisans is 0.4286, and
   this is therefore the low sorting value used. The mean value of issue extremity is 0.65 (the
                                 median, not shown here, is 0.67).
             Figure 5.3. Difference in warmth bias by sorting in matched samples
Note: Respondents are matched on ideology, issue extremity, political knowledge, education,
 age, sex, race, geographical location, and church attendance. The only observed difference
 between the two bars is the degree to which party identity aligns with ideological identity.
Bars represent the mean level of warmth bias for each group. Ninety-five percent confidence
                                      intervals are shown.
                    Figure 5.4. Predicted social-distance bias by social sorting
 Note: Bars represent predicted values of social-distance bias at varying levels of social sorting
   in the YouGov 2011 sample, across three levels of issue positions, controlling for political
      knowledge, education, race, gender, income, age, and church attendance. Originating
regression is shown in appendix table A.6. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are shown.
 The lowest observed value of the social-sorting scale among strong partisans is 0.43, and this
  is therefore the low sorting value used. Social distance scale ranges from 0 (no difference in
   willingness to interact socially with members of the two parties) to 1 (maximal difference
    in willingness to interact socially with members of the two parties). There is a significant
     interaction between issue extremity and constraint in this model, so both variables are
  included, both set at their minimum, mean, and maximum values for each set of predicted
                                              values.
      Figure 5.5. Predicted warmth bias by levels of social sorting and policy attitudes
  Note: Bars represent predicted values of warmth bias (the difference between Democratic
   and Republican feeling thermometers) at varying levels of social sorting in the YouGov
 2011 sample, controlling for political knowledge, education, race, gender, income, age, and
church attendance. Originating regression is shown in appendix table A.7. Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals are shown. Mean value of policy extremity is 0.66, of policy constraint is
                          0.56, and of social sorting is 0.71 out of 1.0.
               Figure 6.1. Anger toward the outgroup presidential candidate
  Note: Data drawn from the weighted ANES cumulative data file, 1948– 2012. Numbers
represent the percentage of people who reported feeling angry at the outgroup presidential
  candidate, coded as a presidential candidate of the party that the respondent does not
       belong to. Question was first asked in 1980. Pure independents are excluded.
               Figure 6.2. Enthusiasm for the ingroup presidential candidate
   Note: Data drawn from the weighted ANES cumulative data file, 1948– 2012. Numbers
 represent the percentage of people who reported feeling proud of the ingroup presidential
candidate, coded as a presidential candidate of the party that the respondent does belong to.
                              Pure independents are excluded.
   Figure 6.3. Change in anger and issue extremity between 1992 and 1996 by sorting
Note: Data drawn from the ANES 1992–1996 Panel Study. Demographic controls are not
necessary as this is a reinterview of the same individuals. Sorting is limited to the partisanideological sorting measure, due to data limitations.
         Figure 6.4. Predicted probability of feeling anger at the outgroup candidate
Note: Predicted probabilities drawn from a logit model using weighted ANES data from the
cumulative file through 2012. Controls are included for issue extremity and constraint (and
 their interaction), education, sex, race, age, southern location, urban location, and church
   attendance. Originating regression is shown in appendix table A.8. Ninety-five percent
                                 confidence intervals shown.
           Figure 6.5. Predicted probability of feeling proud of ingroup candidate
 Note: Predicted probabilities drawn from a logit model using weighted ANES data through
   2012. Controls are included for issue extremity and constraint, education, sex, race, age,
southern location, urban location, and church attendance. Originating regression is shown in
             appendix table A.8. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals shown.
          Figure 6.6. Percent angry at the outgroup candidate in matched sample
Note: Data drawn from ANES cumulative file through 2012. Ninety-five percent confidence
   intervals shown. Respondents matched on ideological identification, issue extremity,
 education, sex, race, age, southern location, and church attendance. Low sorting and high
                sorting are divided by cutting the sorting score at its median.

Note: Ninety-five percent confidence intervals shown. Data drawn from the ANES cumulative
file through 2012. Samples are matched on ideology, issue extremity, education, sex, race, age,
                      south/nonsouth location, and church attendance.
    Figure 7.5. Predicted values of activism among strong partisans across levels of sorting
   Note: Bars represent predicted values of activism at varying levels of partisan-ideological
 sorting controlling for a scale of issue extremity and issue constraint (and their interaction),
  political knowledge, race, sex, income, age, and church attendance. Originating regression
  is shown in appendix table A.11. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are shown. This
sample is fully weighted. The low sorting score is not zero, but 0.0857, the lowest sorting score
                            possible given a strong partisan identity.

     Figure 7.8. Predicted values of prior political engagement from abortion identity versus
                     abortion extremity versus abortion extremity* importance
    Note: Ninety-five percent confidence intervals shown. Identity measured from four items
 including (1) How important is being pro-choice/pro-life to you? (2) How well does the term
 pro-choice/pro-life describe you? (3) When talking about pro-choice/pro-life people how often
 do you use “we” instead of “they”? (4) To what extent do you think of yourself as pro-choice/
  pro-life? Prior political activism includes working for a political party or candidate, engaging
   in political protest, writing a letter or email to a political official, and donating money to a
    political party or candidate (a count recoded to range from 0 to 1). Panels A and C derive
    from a model including the interactive term between extremity and importance. Panel B
    only includes extremity and does not control for identity. All models control for race, sex,
income, age, political knowledge, and church attendance. Originating regressions are shown in
                                          appendix table A.13.

Table A.3 Example calculation of sociopartisan sorting scores

Individual A: Highest-score Republican                      Individual B: Lowest-score Republican

Republican identity = 1                                     Republican identity = 0
Democratic identity = NA                                    Democratic identity = NA
Conservative identity = 1                                   Conservative identity = NA
Liberal identity = NA                                       Liberal identity = −1
Evangelical identity = 1                                    Evangelical identity = NA
Secular identity = NA                                       Secular identity = −1
Black identity = NA                                         Black identity = −1
Tea Party identity = 1                                      Tea Party identity = NA
Sorting score = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)/4 = 1                       Sorting score = (0 − 1 − 1 − 1)/4 = −0.75

Note: Sorting score rescaled to range from 0 to 1 by adding 0.75, then dividing by 1.75. No respondent
rated the lowest sorting score. One Democrat scored −0.61 before recoding, and one Republican scored
−0.27. The lowest recoded score is therefore 0.08. Nineteen respondents scored a perfect 1. All variables
are coded to range between 0 and 1. Each identity score is generated from the four-item scale assessing
social identification with the group. Party-inconsistent groups are reverse coded to range from –1 to 0.
“NA” indicates a missing score.

Note: Coefficients represent changes in levels of activism. Bold coefficients are significant at the p < .05
level. Standard errors in parentheses. All models are OLS models with robust standard errors. All variables are coded to range from 0 to 1. Coefficients should be interpreted with caution, as the partisanidentity and sorting measures are related by construction, so holding one constant while moving the
other is not precisely possible. The predicted values take account of this problem by holding both
variables constant at one value, but the regression coefficients do not. Data are weighted and drawn
from the cumulative ANES file through 2012.

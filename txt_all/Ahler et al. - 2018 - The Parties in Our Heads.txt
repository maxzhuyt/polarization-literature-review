The Parties in Our Heads: Misperceptions about
Party Composition and Their Consequences
Douglas J. Ahler, Florida State University

We document a large and consequential bias in how Americans perceive the major political parties: people tend to considerably overestimate the extent to which party supporters belong to party-stereotypical groups. For instance, people think
that 32% of Democrats are LGBT (vs. 6% in reality) and 38% of Republicans earn over $250,000 per year (vs. 2% in reality).
Experimental data suggest that these misperceptions are genuine and party speciﬁc, not artifacts of expressive responding,
innumeracy, or ignorance of base rates. These misperceptions are widely shared, though bias in out-party perceptions is
larger. Using observational and experimental data, we document the consequences of this perceptual bias. Misperceptions
about out-party composition are associated with partisan affect, beliefs about out-party extremity, and allegiance to one’s
own party. When provided information about the out-party’s actual composition, partisans come to see its supporters as less
extreme and feel less socially distant from them.


P      artisanship is arguably the most fundamental identity in
       American political life. Not only does it strongly inﬂuence vote choice (e.g., Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder 2008; Bartels 2000), it also colors how partisans process

between 0 and 1. The dashed vertical line denotes the point at which average bias p 0 when not rescaled. Perceptions of out-party composition were

     Biased Assimilation and Attitude Polarization: The Effects of
        Prior Theories on Subsequently Considered Evidence

             People who hold strong opinions on complex social issues are likely to examine
             relevant empirical evidence in a biased manner. They are apt to accept "confirming" evidence at face value while subjecting "discontinuing" evidence to
             critical evaluation, and as a result to draw undue support for their initial positions from mixed or random empirical findings. Thus, the result of exposing
             contending factions in a social dispute to an identical body of relevant empirical evidence may be not a narrowing of disagreement but rather an increase in polarization. To test these assumptions and predictions, subjects
             supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to two purported
             studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly disconfirming their existing beliefs about the deterrent efficacy of the death penalty. As predicted, both
             proponents and opponents of capital punishment rated those results and
             procedures that confirmed their own beliefs to be the more convincing and
             probative ones, and they reported corresponding shifts in their beliefs as the
             various results and procedures were presented. The net effect of such evaluations and opinion shifts was the postulated increase in attitude polarization.

The human understanding when it has once adopted              vation in terms of the symbols or metaphors

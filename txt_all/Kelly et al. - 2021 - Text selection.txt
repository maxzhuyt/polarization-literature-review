Figure 2. Partisanship of congressional speech.
NOTES: Average partisanship of U.S. congressional speech is the posterior mass that an observer with a neutral prior expects to place on a speaker’s true party after
hearing the speaker utter a single phrase averaged over speakers in each congressional session (see Section 3). DMR-based partisanship is the preferred estimator of
Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy (2019). HDMR-based estimates decompose divergence between Democrats and Republicans into two: inclusion partisanship measures
what an observer would expect to learn about a speaker’s party affiliation from the inclusion of a phrase in a speech, while repetition partisanship measures what they
expect to learn from an additional repetition of a phrase already observed. The congressional speech data is from Matthew Gentzkow’s website. The “actual” series is from
actual data and the “placebo” series is from hypothetical data in which each speaker’s party is randomly assigned with the probability that the speaker is Republican equal
to the average share of speakers who are Republican in the sessions in which the speaker is active. The shaded region around each series represents a 90% pointwise
confidence interval obtained via subsampling (see Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy 2019, Section 4.4).

NOTES: We report the ten most Republican and Democratic phrases in select sessions of the US congress. Phrase partisanship is based on congressional speeches and defined in Section 3.3. For each session, we separately sort on inclusion partisanship, on repetition
 partisanship, and on any utterance partisanship. We also report the predicted number of occurrences per 100,000 phrases for each phrase by Republicans (#R) and Democrats (#D).

Figure 5. Backcasting the intermediary capital ratio with text and covariates.
NOTES: The figure shows the predicted intermediary capital ratio (icrt ) using the log price dividend ratio (pdt ), realized variance of financial stocks (rvfin) over the same
month, over the prior month, and over the prior year, and monthly WSJ front page phrase counts, over the extended sample, June 1927 to February 2016. The intermediary
capital ratio is only available starting January 1970. Our proposed model, the hurdle distributed multinomial regression (HDMR), which excludes prior year financial stocks
variance (rvfint−13→t−1 , bottom line) from the repetition equation, is compared with three benchmarks: (a) distributed multinomial regression (DMR, Taddy 2015), which
is provided with the same covariates and text, (b) support vector regression (SVR), and (c) linear regression of the target on the same covariates without the text (No Text).

NOTES: The table reports the top 20 phrases whose removal from the corpus causes the largest deterioration in out-of-sample root-mean-squared-error ( OOS RMSE),
 when predicting the intermediary capital ratio (icrt ) using text and the log price dividend ratio (pdt ), realized variance of financial stocks (rvfin) over the same month,
 over the prior month, and over the prior year. The text includes monthly WSJ front page phrase counts, over the subsample when the capital ratio is available, January
 1970 to February 2016. Panel (a) uses 10 random folds for validation while Panel (b) uses pseudo out-of-sample prediction, starting with the latter half of the sample and
 rolling back one observation at a time. We also report full sample HDMR coefficients on icrt for phrase inclusion (δ) and repetition (ϕ), and mean counts and inclusions
 across observations. The corpus includes the 10,000 most frequent two-word phrases (bigrams) in separate sentences, after removing case, stopwords, nonletters and

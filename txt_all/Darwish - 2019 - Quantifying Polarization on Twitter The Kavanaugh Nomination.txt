        Abstract. In contrast to dark (illegal, covert, illicit) or bright (legal, overt,
        above-ground) networks, gray networks conduct a mixture of legal and illegal
        activities and have an organizational structure that may be only partially known.
        The goal of this research is to demonstrate techniques for using trace data from
        Venmo, a payment network, and Facebook, a social networking site, to
        understand the organizational structure of one particular gray network: a
        membership organization of self-described “Western chauvinists” called Proud
        Boys. Using publicly-available data from the Facebook API and from the
        Venmo web site, this research reveals the underlying organizational structure for
        this group as it grew and matured from October 2016–March 2019. The payment network is modeled as a one-mode directed network of payers and payees
        conducting transactions such as dues payments and activity fees. A two-mode
        network of the Venmo users and their memberships in Proud Boys groups on
        Facebook further illuminates the structure of the organization. Supplementary
        data from news reports and arrest records is used to conﬁrm the ﬁndings from
        this network analysis. Results will be useful for understanding the extent to
        which trace data from online activities can expose the offline organizational
        structure of semi-clandestine groups.

1 Introduction

Founded by far-right political commentator and media personality Gavin McInnes in
September 2016, “Proud Boys” is a membership organization describing itself as
“proud Western chauvinists who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world”
[1]. Claiming chapters in 38 states in the US and internationally [2], membership in the
group is “limited to persons who were born male, who currently identify as male”
according to their bylaws [3]. The bylaws also state that the group does not consider
itself a gang, and its website explains that Proud Boys is “a bona ﬁde men’s club with
rituals, traditions, and even its own in-house court called ‘The Sharia’” [4]. On its home
page, the group describes itself as a place for men who have “tried being ashamed of
themselves and accepting blame for slavery, the wage gap, ableism, and some fagbashing that went on two generations ago” and are now “completely ﬁnished” with
being “politically correct” and with “apology culture” [4].

                      Understanding Gray Networks Using Social Media Trace Data        203

    Proud Boys have captured the attention of law enforcement, media, and extremist
monitoring groups for their anti-Muslim, misogynist rhetoric and for their embrace of
street ﬁghting and politically-motivated violence [5]. They have sponsored harassment
of the Muslim town of Islamberg, New York [6]. They afﬁliated with a right-wing
street ﬁghting group called the “Alt-Knights” [7]. Their members have been arrested
for violent street brawling in Oregon [8] and convicted of assaults in New York [9].
Their former lawyer was disbarred in Texas [10], and they have been banned from
Twitter [11], Facebook, and Instagram [12].
    Although extolling one’s public allegiance to Proud Boys on social media is a
requirement for achieving the ﬁrst degree of initiation [3], many members use aliases
online and in person [13, 14]. The group is also reticent about sharing details of its
leadership structure. For example, when its bylaws were re-written and re-published in
November of 2018 following the supposed departure of McInnes from the group [15],
the names of the new leaders (called “Elders” [16]) were intended to have been
redacted from the document [17]. However, in the initial release of the bylaws the
redaction was unsuccessful, and the names of the Elders were in fact visible by using a
computer mouse to highlight the redacted text [18, 19].
    Thus, we posit that Proud Boys are a “gray” network: a semi-clandestine group
with characteristics of both dark (covert, illegal) and bright (overt, legal) networks [31,
32]. For example, when allowed, Proud Boys will use above-ground social media sites
to recruit, fundraise, and organize. However, they also use aliases, have secretive
vetting procedures for new members, and engage in street-ﬁghting and violence. They
have even developed their own specialized jargon that has evolved to assist in their
member acculturation and in-group identity. Phrases like POYB (“proud of your boy”)
and CUAWF (“see you at WestFest”) are used to identify members, while phrases like
FAFO (“fuck around and ﬁnd out”) and “helicopter rides for commies” are used to
intimidate people they identify as enemies.
    The purpose of this research is to use social network analysis and publicly available
data to understand more about the activities and organizational structure of the Proud
Boys as a gray network. To map the ﬁnancial organization and fundraising activities of
the group, we collected 461 transactions between 179 Proud Boys using Venmo, a
social payments network, to conduct group business during the period October 2016–
March 2019. To understand more about the social structure of the Proud Boys, we use
data collected about the membership of 7920 Facebook users in 157 Proud Boysafﬁliated Facebook groups during the period June 2017–March 2018. We use social
network analysis techniques to demonstrate that trace data from these social media sites
can indeed reveal pieces of a “gray” network’s geographic organization, leadership
hierarchy, and activity calendar.
    Section 2 reviews the literature on the characteristics of dark and clandestine social
networks and speciﬁes how this work adds to that literature. Section 3 describes how
the data used in this project was collected from Venmo and Facebook. Section 4
presents the method for and results of social network analysis on this data. Section 5
reviews some of the limitations of this approach, suggests avenues for future work with
this data, and presents a brief conclusion.

2 Background and Prior Work

Dark networks come in many shapes and sizes. Much prior research on covert networks
comes out of a desire to understand how to deploy effective disruption strategies [20,
21] for terrorist organizations, criminal gangs, and drug trafﬁckers.
     Dark networks can be modeled as collections of nodes, usually people, who may all
be members of the network being studied or who may be co-conspirators or associates.
These nodes are connected by edges representing some relationship: ﬁnancial, familial,
social, and so on. Edges usually comprise a single type of relationship but if there are
multiple ties between people, it is possible to build a multi-graph where multiple edges
between nodes is expressed as a vector of possible actions, for example in the work of
Shetty and Adibi on the Enron email dataset [22].
     Because a key differentiator for dark networks is that they operate under risk, the
literature on dark network topologies focuses on whether the network exhibits the signs
of a tradeoff between maintaining secrecy and ease-of-communication [23, 24]. Networks with high requirements for secrecy will sacriﬁce efﬁcient communication by
distributing it through a less centralized network, thus insulating leaders and avoiding
single points of failure. Krebs [25] demonstrates this by measuring the average path
length through the network and distances between the 19 hijacker nodes in the 9/11
terrorist network, concluding that the network has a “serpent” shape.
     Morselli et al. [26] agree that terrorist networks and criminal enterprises have
different shapes (terrorist networks lack a single core, for instance), but they assert that
different “times to task” drive the shape of the network. Being ﬁnancially motivated,
criminal networks have a shorter “time to task” and may therefore prioritize communication efﬁciency over secrecy. In doing so, [26] ﬁnds that criminal networks adopt a
more hierarchical, clustered structure with identiﬁable hubs. Terrorist networks on the
other hand, are motivated by ideology, and will wait for an optimal time to act. They
can therefore tolerate a network structure and communication flow that are more dispersed. By way of example, when 18 co-conspirator nodes are added to the 9/11 terror
network, [26] shows that the path lengths and network distance are decreased (i.e.
communication flow is improved) but secrecy is jeopardized.
     Similarly, Xu and Chen [27] ﬁnd that dark networks with “small world” properties
– those in which nodes that are not neighbors can still reach other nodes in a relatively
low number of hops – lead to efﬁcient communication paths even in a sparse network.
In such networks, the hub nodes are less vulnerable than in a hierarchical or highly
clustered network, and instead it is the bridge nodes connecting multiple subcommunities together that are the most vulnerable. Morselli [28] points out that
locating key players in a dark network can be more difﬁcult than simply looking for
nodes with high centrality measures, however, since higher-status individuals may
purposely insulate themselves from more vulnerable positions in the network.
Depending on what relationship is being used to create the ties between nodes, highstatus individuals may not appear on the network at all.
     Magouirk et al. [29] additionally provide evidence that dark networks change over
time and will change shape based on responses to unplanned events, such as the
departure of a key leader or the intermarrying of families involved in the network. Kalm


                      Understanding Gray Networks Using Social Media Trace Data         205

[30] summarizes structural characteristics of four different types of dark networks
(traditional criminal, cybercriminal, ideologically motivated, and state-sponsored) and
compares similarities and differences between types, with special attention to the
network’s ability to resist disruption.
    Millward and Raab [31, 32] concede that many “dark” networks are not entirely
dark, but have elements common to legal, visible/overt networks as well. They term
these “gray” networks and describe the various circumstances that can put a network
into a legal or visibility gray area. For example, an organization may have multiple
layers to it, with some of its actors conducting business below-ground (dark) and some
above-ground (bright). Or, an organization might be conducting business that is legal
(bright) in one jurisdiction but illegal (dark) in another.
    While a few examples of gray networks are listed in these papers, to our knowledge
no prior work speciﬁcally studies a gray network. Both [31] and [29] stress that classifying a network as “bright” or “dark” or “gray” is less about strict deﬁnitions and more
about empirical observation of the data driving the network. Thus, our project is datadriven, and advances this prior work in two ways. First, we intentionally investigate a
gray network, a typology which is understudied in the literature. Second, we collect data
from publicly-available sources on two different types of relationships – ﬁnancial and
social – to learn about the Proud Boys gray network as it changes over time.


3 Data Collection

The data for this work is comprised of three main subsets: (1) data collected from the
public ledger of Venmo, a payment social network; (2) data collected from the Facebook public group API; (3) data collected from arrest records, news articles, and from
the Proud Boys own media channels. In this section, we will describe how the data was
collected, stored, and cleaned.

3.1   Venmo Data
Venmo is a social network and payment system. Users can request and send monetary
payments to one another using the platform, and users can also add people as their
“friends” on the platform. Friends can be added from a phone contact list or from an
existing Facebook account. Users who request or send money are encouraged to add a
comment to each transaction. Venmo user accounts and transactions are “public by
default” [33]. A 2018 Federal Trade Commission complaint about Paypal, Venmo’s
parent company, describes Venmo privacy this way:
    “By default, all peer-to-peer transactions on Venmo are displayed on the Venmo
social news feed. On this news feed, Respondent displays the names of the payer and
recipient, the date of the transaction, and a message written by the user that initiated the
transaction, to anyone using Respondent’s service. In addition, each Venmo user has a
proﬁle page on Respondent’s website that lists the user’s Venmo transactions. A user’s
ﬁve most recent public Venmo transactions are visible, by default, to anyone who
views the user’s Venmo web page, including to visitors who do not have a Venmo
account.” [34, p.4]


206     M. Squire

    For this project, a list of 193 Proud Boys with public Venmo accounts was compiled manually. Accounts were initially discovered using names of 15 known Proud
Boys who have appeared in news media accounts of their activities [e.g. 19, 35] or in
feature stories in the Proud Boys Magazine [36]. From these 15 accounts, viewing
public Venmo transactions and friends lists yielded additional Proud Boy members or
close afﬁliates. Each person was only added to the list if one or more of the following
conditions were met:
• Person had same name, same photo, and similar friends as a conﬁrmed Proud Boy
  who was openly in Proud Boys groups on other social media; or
• Person used Proud Boys, PB, POYB or other Proud Boys slogans in their comments
  on transactions (e.g. “January dues POYB”), or
• Person was wearing Proud Boys apparel in their Venmo photo or had some Proud
  Boys signiﬁer in their Venmo name.
    Of these 193 accounts, 179 accounts had publicly viewable transactions for which
the comments indicated Proud Boys business was being conducted. We deﬁne Proud
Boys business as:
• Paying dues to or collecting dues from another known Proud Boy; or
• Contributing money to or collecting money for a Proud Boys sponsored event such
  as travel to a rally; or
• Buying or selling goods (e.g. shirts, alcohol, food) for a Proud Boys sponsored
  social event; or
• Buying or selling tickets to Proud Boys sponsored events (e.g. WestFest or
  TexFest).
    In all, 461 transactions were collected between the 179 different user accounts. In
Venmo it is not possible for a third party to see the amount of a transaction between
two parties, however most of the payments in this data set included very clear language
like “dues” or “tickets.” However, humorous comments, emojis, and jokes between
Venmo users are common [37]. We collected transactions of this nature only if they
were between two known Proud Boys.

3.2   Facebook Data
For this portion of the project, we collected data about members and administrators of
Proud Boys groups on Facebook. On Facebook, groups can be set up as one of three
types [38]: Public, Closed or Secret. Membership lists are visible for Public groups, and
until June 15, 2018 Closed group membership lists were also viewable by any Facebook user [39]. In all, 157 Proud Boys groups were located on Facebook.
    Then, the public Facebook Graph API version 2.10 was used to collect the group
membership rosters from all 157 Proud Boys groups. The membership roster for each
group included the group name, each member’s name, and the member’s role in the
group (e.g. member, administrator). Until April 4, 2018, these membership rosters were
available via the Facebook developer API to anyone with a valid authentication token
[39]. All of the data for this portion of the project was collected using the Facebook API between June 20, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Many of these Proud Boys and


                       Understanding Gray Networks Using Social Media Trace Data           207

Alt-Knights groups were reported to have been removed by Facebook as of October
2018 [40], however numerous groups and brand pages for both organizations still
remain active on Facebook as of this writing.
    In all, 7920 different Facebook user accounts were collected from the 157 groups.
Within these groups, 152 of them were “Closed” and 5 were “Public”. 287 different
user accounts served as administrators for at least one of the 157 groups.

3.3    Other Data
In this section we describe additional data sources to conﬁrm offline participation and
geographical location for discovered members, and to construct a timeline of events to
help explain the growth of the group. We prioritized primary source documents such as
the Proud Boys’ own bylaws [3, 19] and the web-based Proud Boys magazine [36].
Newspaper articles with interviews and arrest reports were also helpful to this project.
The tasks of geolocating as many members as possible and constructing a timeline of
events was made much easier by newspaper accounts of arrests and interviews at rallies
and events. Table 1 shows the timeline of key events that helped to inform the network
analyses in Sect. 4.

4 Data Analysis

In this section we use the data collected from Venmo, Facebook, and the events
timeline to understand more about the structure of the Proud Boys as a gray network.

4.1   Venmo Network
The ﬁrst Venmo transaction in our data set was from October 11, 2016 and the ﬁnal
was from March 24, 2019. Figure 1 shows the number of transactions per quarter. The
most noticeable large jump between 3rd (July-September) quarter and 4th quarter
(October-December) 2017 follows the ﬁrst annual WestFest event, held in Las Vegas
on September 8-10, 2017. On October 2, 2017, a large chapter in the Northeast region
of the United States began using Venmo to take dues.

gray. Right: Proud Boys facebook group administrators shown in black.

    Figure 2 shows a directed network in which the 179 Venmo user accounts are
nodes and the payer-payee transactions are directed edges. This graph was generated in
Gephi [51] using the Yifan Hu layout [52] with node size scaled for degree.
    Edges are left unweighted for visibility reasons, but labels have been added to show
geographically-related Venmo users. Regular member and afﬁliate nodes are shown in
gray. The graph reveals a large component subgraph and two smaller, self-contained
subgraphs representing the Northeast chapter and a smaller Florida chapter. Both of the
large Texas nodes are alias accounts set up to take payments for TexFest.
    The left graph shows in black each of the ﬁve “Elders” who has an account on
Venmo. These ﬁve represented geographically distinct areas: Northeast, Georgia,
Midwest, West, and Paciﬁc Northwest. The three remaining Elders hailed from
Canada, Florida, and Texas but were – to our knowledge – not Venmo users.
    Our social network analysis of Venmo payments shows that the Elders seem to be
geographically dispersed, however nothing in the bylaws indicates that geography is a
criterion for being chosen as an Elder. The lack of an Elder from the New York City
cluster is surprising, but since New York is the home of Founder Gavin McInnes, this
may have played a role in whether to appoint an Elder from this area.
    The right graph in Fig. 2 shows in black the 26 Venmo Proud Boys who were also
the administrator of at least one Facebook group. All eight Elders administered at least
one Facebook group. The administrators of the Facebook groups are geographically
dispersed and not limited to Elders or high-Venmo-degree individuals.
    Next, to learn how the network grew and changed over time, Fig. 3 (next page)
shows the social network evolving across 10 quarters. To make this graph, the ﬁrst
three quarters were combined since they are relatively small and self-similar. The next
seven quarters show periods of great activity. Table 2 describes each frame.

             Table 2. Explanation of Venmo network activity shown in Fig. 3
Frame     Quarter        Explanation

2         3Q 2017        A small group is added from California and the mountain West.
                         WestFest is held in Las Vegas
3         4Q 2017        A large group of members from the Northeast states (Rhode Island,
                         Massachusetts, Connecticut) has joined and are paying dues to a
                         central leader. Eight smaller cells form, shown in the lower left,
                         including a four-member Florida cell
4         1Q 2018        Texas cell emerges, sending payments for 2018 TexFest. Three of
                         the smaller cells merge into the main subgraph
5         2Q 2018        Georgia/Carolinas nodes merge into main subgraph. Florida, Texas
                         and Northeast are still separate
6         3Q 2018        The Paciﬁc Northwest strand is expanded as its smaller cells are
                         completely absorbed into main subgraph. Only Florida, Texas, and
                         Northeast remain as separate cells
7         4Q 2018        New nodes are added to main network, Texas, and Northeast
8         1Q 2019        Texas is absorbed into main network; second Texas cell emerges as
                         2019 TexFest tickets are sold

4.2   Facebook Network of Venmo Users
Next we consider in more depth the network of Proud Boys who were on both Venmo
and Facebook. What can we learn about the gray network from their participation on
both social networks? 107 of the Venmo Proud Boys also had identiﬁable Facebook
accounts. These users joined 118 of the 157 Facebook groups in our collection.
    Figure 4 (next page) shows a two-mode network [53] in which person nodes only
connect to groups, not to each other. The OpenOrd [54] layout is used to emphasize
clustering between people and groups. The settings for OpenOrd were chosen to
maximize cluster ﬁnding (liquid phase, 25%; expansion, 50%; cooldown, 15%; crunch,
5%; simmer, 5%). On the left graph, Facebook groups are shown in black and


                     Understanding Gray Networks Using Social Media Trace Data     211

individual members of those groups are shown in gray. On the right graph, the ﬁve
Venmo Elder nodes are shown in black, as well as a sixth (alias) account for the
Northeast Elder.


Fig. 4. Two-mode network of Venmo Proud Boys also using FB. Left: Proud Boys (gray) and
FB groups (black). Right: Proud Boys elders overlaid on FB network.


    As with the network of Venmo transactions shown in Fig. 3, geographic patterns
emerge here as well. Texas, Northeast, Georgia, and Western region users and groups
are clearly visible. Examples of geographically-named Facebook groups in this network include: East Texas Proud Boys, Los Angeles Proud Boys, Proud Boys Atlanta
Vetting Page, Northeast USA Proud Boys - Vetting Group, and the like.
    Despite these geographical similarities, the Facebook network shows two distinct
differences from the Venmo network. First, the Paciﬁc Northwest cell is indistinguishable. While the PNW did have some geographically-oriented Facebook pages,
their members joined enough generic, non-geographic pages (e.g. Proud Boys Gear,
Proud Boys Armory) that no clusters emerged as clearly as they did on the Venmo
diagram.
    Second, two Alt-Knights/FOAK clusters are evident on the upper left of the
Facebook network, but these were not part of the Venmo network at all. The two
principal leaders of these FOAK groups were present in the Venmo data set, but their
impact is much greater in the Facebook network than it was on Venmo. Interestingly,
following the inclusion of FOAK as a defendant in a lawsuit against leaders of the
Unite the Right rally [55], neither of the two FOAK leaders were chosen to be Elders in
the Proud Boys.


212     M. Squire

   Differences between the Venmo and Facebook graphs may be due to the 10-month
time span during which the Facebook data was collected, compared to the longer
timespan of the Venmo data. More limitations will be addressed in Sect. 5.

4.3   Network Metrics
We have established that Proud Boys Elders and Facebook group administrators
occupy geographically dispersed positions in the network, but are these leaders serving
as hubs and bridges in the Venmo network? Network metrics such as degree,
betweenness centrality, and the clustering coefﬁcient can provide insight into this
question.
Are the Proud Boys on Venmo a “small world” network? Literature on dark networks [31] indicates that “small world” characteristics can smooth communication
even in sparse networks (such as this one, which has lots of hubs but fewer bridges).
Small world networks have a higher clustering coefﬁcient, or likelihood that clusters
will form, than a random network of the same size. The clustering coefﬁcient for the
directed network is 0.042, and the clustering coefﬁcient for the undirected version of
the network is 0.216. Random networks of this size measured a clustering coefﬁcient of
between 0.001 and 0.008, with an average of 0.003. Following [31], this higher
clustering coefﬁcient indicates that the Proud Boys Venmo network does exhibit “small
world” characteristics, including clusters, hubs, and bridges.

Fig. 5. Degree and betweenness ranks for elder and leader nodes. Red = bridges; blue = hubs.
(Color ﬁgure online)


Are the Elders and leaders serving as hubs or bridges? Table 3 shows the network
measures for ﬁve Elders and four other leader nodes, including the two TexFest ticket
selling nodes (2018 and 2019) and two known NYC leaders. Ranks (1-179) for degree
and betweenness are given in parentheses.
     Degree is useful for ﬁnding Proud Boys that serve as hubs on Venmo. Four of the
ﬁve Elders are found in the top nine highest degree nodes. The TexFest nodes and
NYC leaders are also in the top nine. Betweenness centrality measures a node’s
capacity to serve as a bridge, measuring how many times the shortest path between any
two nodes goes through a given node. Here we switched to an undirected network in
order to more accurately reflect the two-way relationship opportunities presented by
Venmo. As shown in Table 3, eight of the nine Elders and leaders are ranked in the top
13 of all nodes for betweenness.
     Figure 5 shows a scatter plot of the degree ranks and the betweenness ranks for the
nine Elders and leaders. Nodes are colorized red for bridges and blue for hubs. Hubs
get top ranks for degree and rank lower on betweenness. Bridges have good
betweenness rankings but lower degree rankings. The Midwest Elder is shown in black
as neither a hub nor a bridge.


5 Limitations, Future Work, and Conclusions

There are several limitations to the way we approached understanding the Proud Boys
as a gray network. First, our Facebook data set was limited to only 10 months of data,
and while those months did directly overlap with the Venmo data set, the Venmo data
set continued after our research access to the Facebook data had been removed. Second, not every Venmo transaction was publicly visible, due to privacy settings of each
individual user. Third, the set of Proud Boys using Venmo is small, compared to
number of Proud Boys on Facebook. A full analysis of the Facebook network would be
a valuable addition. Finally, we are missing Venmo data from three Elders and we were
also unable to determine the real names controlling the two TexFest accounts.


214     M. Squire

     In terms of future work, we are excited about ﬁnding additional trace data sources
that can illuminate a dark or gray network. Venmo and Facebook are just two of many
possible sources. It was very time-consuming to track down users on these systems, but
the insight we gained was signiﬁcant compared to what had been reported previously.
     In this paper we have shown that trace data from ﬁnancial and social systems can
help to illuminate the structure and organization of a group that heretofore has operated
in shadows. We established a method for using public social media trace data to
understand the structure and organization of the Proud Boys, a semi-clandestine, “gray”
network. Financial data from Venmo and membership data from Facebook groups are
used to construct two social networks of group membership. Both social networks
reveal geographically-based clusters. Individual nodes in these clusters are then compared to known Elders and other leaders of the group. We ﬁnd that leaders hold both
“hub” and “bridge” positions in the network, and the network has a communicationsmoothing “small world” structure. Like many criminal networks described in the
literature, the Proud Boys network favors communication efﬁciency and leadership
hierarchy.
     Finally, we must point out that in the course of conducting this work, we noticed a
number of Venmo transactions that were concerning. Proud Boys members and Elders
conducted several transactions in which they paid each other to rent buses and
otherwise prepare for rallies that included violence against their perceived “enemies.”
We concede that gray networks are only “gray” until their illegal activities become
known, at which point they would be considered a full-fledged dark network and would
likely move further underground. This work presents a method of studying such a
group while it is still operating on social media, and at least partially without
concealment.

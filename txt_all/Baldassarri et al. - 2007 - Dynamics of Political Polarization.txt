This article accounts for two puzzling paradoxes. The first paradox is the simultaneous
absence and presence of attitude polarization—the fact that global attitude polarization
is relatively rare, even though pundits describe it as common. The second paradox is the
simultaneous presence and absence of social polarization—the fact that while
individuals experience attitude homogeneity in their interpersonal networks, their
networks are characterized by attitude heterogeneity. These paradoxes give rise to
numerous scholarly arguments. By developing a formal model of interpersonal influence
over attitudes in a context where individuals hold simultaneous positions on multiple
issues, we show why these arguments are not mutually exclusive and how they
meaningfully refer to the same social setting. The results from this model provide a single
parsimonious account for both paradoxes. The framework we develop may be
generalized to a wider array of problems, including classic problems in collective action.

Initial Conditions:

—4 issues; issue interest ~ normal ( = 0,  = 33.3); interest range (–100; +100)
—Initialize perceived ideological distance  = mean Euclidean distance among actors

Iteration Flow:
Selection of interaction partners
—At each iteration for each actor:
——Random sample of potential interlocutors ~ to the overall level of interest
——Draw from the sample the actual interlocutors with p = 1 – 

Process of interpersonal influence
—For each pair of actors previously selected:
——Select the issue for discussion
——Compute the change for each actor based on their interest on the issue
——Determine the direction of change according to the sign of the issue
——Update actors’ level of interest
——Update actors’ perceived ideological distance with the current/actual distance

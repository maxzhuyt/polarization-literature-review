politicians from Southern Indian States are cohesively clustered

southern states are more cohesively associated geographically. The
non-cohesive states (meaning they sound like each other) are those
where the dominant nationalist party, the BJP is in clear majority.
In Figure 1(b), we plotted the politicians of the same six states and
it can be seen that the politicians in the northern states are well
segregated based on their party affiliations: showing that their authorship on Twitter is more influenced by their party than their home
state. This indicates that "statism" is relatively stronger in Southern,
non-BJP states.                                                                               (d) M.P.-INC                 (e) Kerala-BJP            (f) Kerala-INC

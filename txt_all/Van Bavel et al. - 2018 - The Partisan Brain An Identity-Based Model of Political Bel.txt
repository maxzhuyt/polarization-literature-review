The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive global health crisis. Because the crisis requires large-scale behaviour change
and places significant psychological burdens on individuals, insights from the social and behavioural sciences can be used to
help align human behaviour with the recommendations of epidemiologists and public health experts. Here we discuss evidence from a selection of research topics relevant to pandemics, including work on navigating threats, social and cultural influences on behaviour, science communication, moral decision-making, leadership, and stress and coping. In each section, we note
the nature and quality of prior research, including uncertainty and unsettled issues. We identify several insights for effective
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight important gaps researchers should move quickly to fill in the coming weeks
and months.

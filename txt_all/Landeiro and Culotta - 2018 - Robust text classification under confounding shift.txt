                                                          For the majority of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates, the observed energy in the
                                                       optical/near-UV bands is of order 1051 erg. We show that this observed energy is smaller than the
                                                       minimum bolometric energy for the radiative inefficient accretion flow model by a factor of 10–100.
                                                       We argue that this discrepancy is because the majority of the energy released is in the extreme-UV

                                                       is supported by existing mid-infrared data and should be further tested by future dust reverberation

on the right panel of Fig. (2). When the feeding rate is super-Eddington (Ṁ ≥ LEdd /ηc2 ), we adopt a minimum bolometric
luminosity Lbol,min ≃ LEdd ; when the feeding rate is sub-Eddington (Ṁ < LEdd /ηc2 ), the accretion flow settles into a thin disk,

substructures, the diametral angular size, the estimated distance and the age of the associated SNR. The last three columns quote the relevant quantities for the
aperture photometry analysis described in Section 5, namely the radii of the chosen aperture (𝑟ap ) and of the internal (𝑟int ) and external (𝑟ext ) boundaries of the

Figure 8. SEDs for W49, W51 and IC443, obtained from the combination of QUĲOTE and ancillary data, for the total intensity 𝐼 (left panels) and the total
polarised intensity 𝑃 (right panels). The flux densities have been obtained via aperture photometry in a 1-degree radius aperture centred in the source, as
detailed in Section 5, considering all maps smoothed at a 1 deg resolution. QUĲOTE points are the only available data for these regions covering the range
between 10 and 20 GHz. Overplotted to the data point we show the best-fit models discussed in Section 6.2; the foregrounds considered for each fit are quoted
in the plot legends. In total intensity the model plotted here for W49 is the one including a synchrotron component with a fixed spectral index (third column in
Table 8), the model for W51 is the one with no synchrotron component (second column in Table 9), and for IC443 we show the model with a broken power-law
synchrotron spectrum (last column of Table 10). When fitting for a dust component in the polarised SEDs, the dust temperature is always fixed to the value
obtained in total intensity; for W51, the DRAO point was not included in the polarisation fit.

APPENDIX A: FLUX CONTRIBUTION FROM
NEIGHBOURING AREAS
As already mentioned in the beginning of Sec. 6.3, given the common resolution of 1 degree that we adopt throughout the frequency
range we explore, the AME signal we detect towards W49 and W51
may have a significant contribution coming from the Galactic emission that surrounds them. In this section we shall refer to the area
surrounding each source, with the exclusion of the source itself,
as the “region”. Although it is not possible to extract further information about the actual spatial distribution of the measured flux
densities, we can still get a rough estimate of the level of the region
contribution in our chosen apertures.
      We repeat the measurement of the flux densities of W49 and
W51, using this time the maps prior to the convolution with a 1degree beam. We focus in particular on the maps with the highest
                                                                             Figure A1. A comparison between the maps at their original resolution (left)

This time we can choose a smaller aperture, in order to only encompass the source angular extent; we select an internal radius of

our measurements.
      The results are summarised in Table A1, where for each of the
selected maps we report its original FWHM value, the flux densities
𝑆or computed on the map at its parent angular resolution, and the
flux densities 𝑆1d computed on the 1-degree smoothed map. The
difference 𝑆1d − 𝑆or is our estimate of the flux proceeding from the
region that makes it into our apertures; it is reported in Table A1
as a fractional contribution with respect to the 1-degree flux 𝑆1d . In
Fig. A1 we also show, for three sample frequencies, the comparison between the maps at their original resolution and the smoothed
maps, together with the circles employed for the photometric analysis in each case.
      We notice that the fractional region flux density in our apertures is in general larger than 50%. Now, because this is the total flux,
which results from the combination of different emission mechanisms, we cannot say that this is the fraction of background AME
that enters the apertures. In fact, the ratios tend to be larger at higher
frequencies, where we are practically dominated by thermal dust
emission and we expect indeed a significant contribution from the
diffuse Galactic dust (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016c). On the
contrary, at the Urumqi frequency, in these regions we are dominated by free-free emission, which is also a relevant component of
the diffuse emission.
      These results show that it is indeed likely that a contribution
of the AME signal does not come from our sources; still, it is

fluxes we adopt an aperture radius 𝑟ap = 20 arcmin for W49 and 𝑟ap = 30 arcmin for W51.

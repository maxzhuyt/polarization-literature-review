Abstract: Research in political science has acknowledged the importance of ethno-nationalism (or
more commonly, nativism) as a constitutive element of radical-right politics, but it has typically
reduced this phenomenon to its downstream correlates, like attitudes toward ethnic and religious
minorities or immigration policy preferences. Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively
studied nationalism as a feature of political culture, but have rarely weighed in on debates about
institutional politics, and the radical-right in particular. In this study, we bring these literatures
together by considering how multiple conceptions of American nationhood shaped respondents’
voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on
long-term changes in the distribution of nationalist beliefs in the U.S. population. The results
suggest that competing definitions of nationhood constitute important cultural cleavages that were
effectively mobilized by candidates from both parties. In particular, we show that exclusionary
varieties of nationalism were strongly predictive of Trump support in the Republican primary and
the general election, while disengagement from the nation was predictive of Sanders support in
the Democratic primary. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted
by party: respondents identifying with the Republican Party have become predominantly ethnonationalist, while those identifying with the Democratic Party have increasingly espoused creedal
and disengaged conceptions of nationhood. The resulting mutual reinforcement of nationalist cleavages with other sources of cultural and demographic distinction represents a potential danger for the
long-term stability of U.S. democracy. More broadly, this research demonstrates that to understand
the 2016 presidential election—and contemporary American political culture—scholars should take
nationalism seriously as a primary source of collective identification and political behavior.

Americans, Not Partisans: Can Priming American
National Identity Reduce Affective Polarization?
Matthew S. Levendusky, University of Pennsylvania


In recent years, Americans have become more affectively polarized: that is, ordinary Democrats and Republicans increasingly dislike and distrust members of the opposing party. Such polarization is normatively troubling, as it exacerbates
gridlock and dissensus in Washington. Given these negative consequences, I investigate whether it is possible to ameliorate
this partisan discord. Building on the Common Ingroup Identity Model from social psychology, I show that when subjects’
sense of American national identity is heightened, they come to see members of the opposing party as fellow Americans
rather than rival partisans. As a result, they like the opposing party more, thereby reducing affective polarization. Using
several original experiments, as well as a natural experiment surrounding the July 4th holiday and the 2008 summer
Olympics, I ﬁnd strong support for my argument. I conclude by discussing the implications of these ﬁndings for efforts to
reduce polarization more generally.


A         mericans, we are told, are a polarized people. While
          initially only political elites were thought to be
          polarized (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006),
now, by some measures, so are ordinary Americans. In particular, there is strong evidence that Americans are affectively

                                  Abstract | Healthy democratic polities feature competing visions of a good society but also
                                  require some level of cooperation and institutional trust. Democracy is at risk when citizens
                                  become so polarized that an ‘us versus them’ mentality dominates. Despite a vast multidisciplinary literature, no coherent conceptual framework of the microlevel dynamics that increase or
                                  decrease polarization has been presented. In this Review, we provide a conceptual framework to
                                  integrate scientific knowledge about cognitive–motivational mechanisms that influence political
                                  polarization and the social-​communicative contexts in which they are enacted. Ego-​justifying
                                  and group-​justifying motives lead individuals to defend their own pre-​existing beliefs and those
                                  of their in-​group, respectively. However, a distinct class of system-​justifying motives contributes
                                  to asymmetric forms of polarization. Whereas conservative-​rightist ideology is associated with
                                  valuing tradition, social order and maintenance of the status quo, liberal-​leftist ideology is associated with a push for egalitarian social change. These cognitive–motivational mechanisms interact
                                  with social influence processes linked to communication source, message and channel factors,
                                  all of which might contribute to increased or decreased polarization. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions and ways in which our framework can be extended to the study of
                                  culture and institutions.

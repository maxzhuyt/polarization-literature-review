Is Polarization a Myth?
Alan I. Abramowitz Emory University
Kyle L. Saunders Colorado State University

      This article uses data from the American National Election Studies and national exit polls to test Fiorina’s
      assertion that ideological polarization in the American public is a myth. Fiorina argues that twenty-first-century
      Americans, like the midtwentieth-century Americans described by Converse, ‘‘are not very well-informed about
      politics, do not hold many of their views very strongly, and are not ideological’’ (2006, 19). However, our evidence
      indicates that since the 1970s, ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the
      United States as well as among political elites. There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and
      Republicans, between red state voters and blue state voters, and between religious voters and secular voters. These
      divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists—they involve a large segment of the public and the
      deepest divisions are found among the most interested, informed, and active citizens. Moreover, contrary to
      Fiorina’s suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout, our evidence indicates that
      polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation.

                                      climate-neutral societies. To this end, this systematic literature review presents the findings of a
                                      content analysis of 27 peer-reviewed scientific articles investigating the relationship between social
                                      media, political polarization, and climate change—preceding Elon Musk's bid to acquire Twitter on
                                      April 14, 2022. The review yields contradictory findings with regard to the degree of polarization in
                                      climate change-related conversations on social media: 13 publications find some instances of
                                      polarization, 6 report none, and 8 remain inconclusive. Despite these divergent results, the review
                                      points to clear relationships between the existence of polarized climate change-related conversations
                                      in the studies' findings and their foci, type of data employed, and forms of polarization approached.
                                      Specifically, polarized climate change-related discussions on social media clearly overshadow
                                      studies that explore communicative interactions, utilize digital trace data, and address affective
                                      polarization. In contrast, in publications investigating the effects of exposure to climate changerelated information on social media, particularly those relying on self-reported data to examine
                                      ideological polarization, the predominant trend is either the absence of polarization or inconclusive
                                      results.

                                                                  INTRODUCTION

           With regard to climate change, political polarization – broadly understood as a "marked political division in
      the population" (Weber et al., 2021) – has arisen in parallel to people's increasing use of social media, averaging
      2 hours and 24 minutes per day according to a global survey conducted in October 2023 (We are social, 2023).
      Social media is defined here as "any website or web-based service that includes web 2.0 characteristics and
      contains some aspect of user generated content" (Gruzd, Staves, & Wilk, 2012, p. 2,341). This increased use has
      induced many scholars to investigate whether, how, and to what extent social media contributes to a polarized
      environmental discourse (Röchert et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2015). In general, these studies reveal that views
      on climate change are divided along ideological and partisan lines. Even in countries with lower levels of
      skepticism about climate change, the proponents and opponents of mitigation policies still tend to be hostile
      toward one another (Chen et al., 2021).
          Polarized discussions about the environment have been shown to have several negative effects, including
      undermining public confidence in human-caused climate change, increasing political inaction (Bruelle, 2014), and
      delaying or impeding mitigation efforts (Cook et al., 2018). There is also substantial evidence for "backfire" or

"boomerang" effects in highly polarized media environments in which climate communication meant to boost
support for mitigation policies (e.g. increased spending) instead fuels resistance from groups that oppose taking
strong countermeasures (W. Chen, Pacheco, Yang, & Menczer, 2021). Addressing the impact social media has on
climate change-related discussions is thus fundamental to the realization of climate-neutral societies and
prevention of social unrest. This is particularly important in pluralistic political regimes, where highly polarized
environments have the "potential to drive antagonism between ideological groups, generate political deadlock and
threaten pluralist democracies," as Falkenberg et al. contend (2021, p. 1).
     The first step to addressing this schism is a better understanding of the characteristics of climate changerelated political polarization on social media. Despite the urgency of the climate situation, research into the causes
and effects of polarized public views in this area remains limited. Moreover, there has to date not been, to the best
of our knowledge, a comprehensive account of the disparate scientific work that has been done on climate changerelated polarization on social media. Our systematic literature review represents such an endeavor. It presents a
unique taxonomy of scientific works on the matter, shedding light on their different theoretical lenses and
methodological approaches, points of alignment and divergence, benefits and drawbacks. Offering such a
comprehensive and critical analysis will hopefully inspire more research in the field.
     Specifically, this systematic literature review presents the findings of a content analysis of 27 peer-reviewed
scientific articles investigating the relationship between social media, political polarization, and climate change
(see Appendix 1). It provides a thorough overview of the trends and dissonances across these studies in terms of
their areas of focus, methods, and results. We then move on to a discussion of these commonalities and
differences, and offer specific conclusions about the current state of the field.
    Similar to Terren and Borge's (2021) literature review on social media and echo chambers, our analysis also
reveals a division between research focusing on social media communication and interaction, on the one side, and
studies concentrating on the effects of content exposure on social media, on the other. A similar split between
studies employing digital trace data and research using self-reported data is also evident. However, unlike Terren
and Borge's results, though, most of the studies included in our systematic literature review depart from the
assumption that the discourse about climate change on social media is subject to polarization, serving as a
premise for assessing the degree of polarization, its linguistic features, and its repercussions for individuals'
climate change-related beliefs and attitudes.
     All in all, this systematic literature review presents a first classification of the peer-reviewed literature on
social media, political polarization, and climate change. It serves to depict the diverse foci, methodological
approaches, and results obtained here. In doing so, it aims to foster further research on this key topic.


                                          DATA AND METHODS

     This systematic review considers scientific studies that have examined political polarization regarding climate
change-related discussions on social media, written in English, and published online in peer-reviewed journals or
conference proceedings between January 1, 2005 (roughly corresponding with the advent of modern social media
platforms) and December 31, 2021 (prior to Elon Musk's bid to acquire Twitter on April 14, 2022). It follows the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol in order to: (a) provide
state of the art knowledge in the field; (b) identify existing research gaps and challenges; and (c) make
recommendations for future research (Page et al., 2021).
     Exclusively focusing on articles published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings that address
social media, political polarization, and climate change meant disregarding a number of seemingly relevant or
otherwise related studies. Several of these focus on polarization in online climate change-related discussions, but
not on social media specifically (Adam, Häussler, Schmid-Petri, & Reber, 2019; Collins & Nerlich, 2015; Häussler,
2019). Other discarded work addresses polarization in the context of climate change-related discussions, but
focuses instead on traditional media — for example, Bohr's (2020) analysis of partisanship and bias vis-à-vis
climate change reporting in print newspapers. Furthermore, there are a number of studies that examine climate
change-related discussions between those holding opposing views on social media, but they do not specifically
examine polarization (Bounegru, De Pryck, Venturini, & Mauri, 2020; Huntington & Anderson, 2015).
     Nevertheless, the decision to restrict the criteria for inclusion to peer-reviewed journals and conference
proceedings was taken to ensure the manageability and transparency, and aligns with the methodological norms
of such systematic reviews (Page et al., 2021). The selection criteria for this systematic literature review meant
overlooking reports, reviews, books, and book chapters of potential relevance (e.g., Bridge, 2021), as well as news
articles and studies published in languages other than English. As such, our study by no means encompasses all of

 the existing literature on social media, political polarization, and climate change, and rather it should be seen as a
 representative collection of the academic literature in English examining political polarization in climate changerelated discussions on social media.
      To identify and retrieve relevant studies focusing on social media, political polarization, and climate change
 existing as peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, we employed a clearly defined keyword search in
 three of the most popular social science academic research databases (Chadegani, 2013): Web of Science, Scopus,
 and ScienceDirect. Additionally, such a search was also performed via Google Scholar. We used Boolean searches
 with the following keywords: "social media" AND "polarization" AND "climate change" (see Appendix 2 for
 further details). This was a topic search that identified correspondence based on titles, abstracts, and keywords.
 Due to the inflated number of relevant studies for the search in Google Scholar (in excess of 15,000 results), we
 selected the first 500 (as sorted by relevance). The searches in Web of Science (31 results), Scopus (276 results),
 ScienceDirect (286 results), and Google Scholar (first 500 results) together yielded 1,093 studies that were
 carefully assessed for eligibility (Figure 1). First, we checked the 1,093 studies for duplicates (n=89).
 Subsequently, we reviewed the titles and abstracts of the remaining 1,004, with two researchers carefully reading
 the titles and abstracts of the manuscripts to determine whether they should be kept or excluded from the analysis.
 Of the 1,004 articles, 952 studies were excluded as they were not about social media, polarization, and climate
 change (n=703), were not peer-reviewed articles or included in conference proceedings (n=246), or were not
 written in English (n=3). Next, both researchers conducted an in-depth, full-text screening of the remaining 52
 articles, leaving them with 27 studies eligible for inclusion in our systematic literature review (see Appendix 3 for
 the discarded 25 articles).

     During the screening process, an analytical framework was developed to identify research aims, foci, and
 questions, types of data, methods of analysis, as well as findings for each of the articles included in the final
 sample. Furthermore, a keyword search was conducted with the open-source software R (R Core Team, 2022),
 using the package ‘pdftools' (Ooms, 2022). The results of the systematic literature review are organized according


                                        Esteve-del-Valle, M. / RCR, Vol. 13, No. Sp, 106-121                            109

to three key areas: foci, methods, and findings. We seek to outline recurring trends, strengths, and weaknesses in
the examined studies, further to providing also a broad overview of the state of the art in the academic debate on
social media, political polarization, and climate change.


                                                      RESULTS

     While our keyword search targeted articles written between 2005 and 2021, the final sample of studies
included in this systematic literature review was published between 2014 and 2021 alone, with a sharp increase
identifiable therein from 2020 (Figure 2). This seems to suggest that research on social media, political
polarization, and climate change is still in its infancy.


    Figure 2. Number of Studies Published on Social Media, Polarization, and Climate Change (2014-2021)


     As for the occurrence of analytically relevant keywords, Figure 3 indicates a "politicization" of discussions
on social media, polarization, and climate change. This is not only apparent through the occurrence of the word
"politics" (n=1,070), but also through the occurrence of ones such as "partisanship" (n=235) and "ideology"
(n=233). Figure 3 also reveals two further key aspects of such discussions, indicated by the numerous occurrences
of the words "networks" (n=991) and "communities" (n=480) respectively.

      Most studies included in this systematic literature review are based on the assumption that polarization exists
 in social media discussions about climate change, suggesting that research in this area has now moved beyond
 seeking to prove the reality of such a schism. With regard to research foci, a broad distinction can be made
 between studies (a) focusing on communicative interactions within and between climate change-related
 communities on social media and (b) those examining the effects of exposure to climate change-related
 information on social media. The first group scrutinizes polarization vis-à-vis climate change-related discussions
 on social media by looking at the characteristics of these communicative interactions, while the second
 investigates the impact that exposure to climate change-related information on social media has on users.
     Studies Focusing on Communicative Interactions within and between Climate Change-related Communities
 on Social Media
      The vast majority of the studies included in our systematic literature review investigate polarized
 communicative interactions regarding climate change on social media (Moernaut, Mast, Temmerman, &
 Broersma, 2020; Chen et al., 2021). Within this group of studies, several engage with the linguistic features of
 such polarized climate change-related discussions. For example, Anderson and Huntington (2017) turn to the use
 of sarcasm and incivility in Twitter discussions about climate change during an extreme-weather event; Olausson
 (2018) investigates the legitimation of livestock production in everyday discourse on Facebook; Meza, Shapiro,
 and Park (2018) study the topics, sentiments, and argumentative mechanisms informing climate change-related
 YouTube comments; and, Al-Rawi, OʼKeefe, Kane, & Bizimana (2021) examine the role of the term "fake news" in
 climate change-related discussions on Twitter. Related studies examine the linguistic differences between users or
 communities on either "side" of the climate change debate. Jang and Hart (2015) address differences in preferred
 language use when it comes to climate change's communication for those accepting and questioning the
 phenomenon's existence respectively; Tyagi, Babcock, Carley, and Sicker (2020), and Tyagi, Uyheng, and Carley
 (2020) quantify hostile communication on Twitter, dividing between those who believe in the anthropogenic
 causes of climate change (believers) and those who are skeptical of this view (disbelievers); and, Cann, Weaver,
 and Williams (2021) assess how ideological orientation affects the behavior of sharing content online for left-wing
 environmentalists versus right-wing climate skeptics.
       A second stream of research primarily examines the structural features of climate change-related
 communities that exist on social media. These studies identify the network structures of related online discussions
 and assess, through an examination of the frequency of the communicative interactions within and between
 climate change-related communities on social media, whether these users mostly interact with like-minded
 individuals or with those who think differently (Röchert et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2015). Other studies
 approach polarization within climate change-related discussions on social media by focusing on the individual
 characteristics of the opposing communities' members—comparing, for instance, the social media consumption
 patterns of people with a high-risk perception regarding climate change versus those with a low-risk view (van Eck,
 Mulder, & van der Linden, 2021). Studies also examined whether a relationship exists between users' political
 affiliation and their stance on climate change (Helmuth, Gouhier, Scyphers, & Mocarski, 2016).
      Lastly, several studies explore both the linguistic features of the polarized communication occurring between
 climate change-related communities on social media and the defining characteristics of these collectives. Pearce,
 Holmberg, Hellsten, and Nerlich (2014) note the topics addressed in climate change-related discussions on social
 media with regard to the 2013 IPCC Working Group 1 report; Arlt, Rauchfleisch, and Schäfer (2019) study the
 linguistic and topological differences between climate change-related communities on social media; and, Marlow,
 Miller, and Roberts (2021) analyze the presence of bots in climate change-related conversations on Twitter and
 the topics that these entities address in their tweets.
      Studies on the Effects of Exposure to Climate Change-related Information on Social Media
      Although most of the work included in this review investigates climate change-related communicative
 interactions within and between communities on social media, close to one-third of them specifically analyze the
 effects of being exposed to climate change-related information on social media. Most of these studies address the
 effects of exposure on individual beliefs. For example, Samantray and Pin (2019) conducted Twitter conversations
 about climate change (2007–2017) to assess the impact of homophily on the polarization of individual viewpoints;
 and Diehl, Huber, Gil de Zúñiga, and J. Liu (2021) evaluated the consequences of news consumption via social
 media for people's climate change-related outlooks. A second group of studies scrutinize the effects of exposure to
 climate change-related information on social media on a user's subsequent engagement with climate-related
 topics on these platforms. Chapman, Corner, Webster, and Markowitz (2016) study users' perceptions and
 reactions to photographic climate change-related material shared on social media; Jennings, Allen, and Le Vu
 Phuong (2021) investigate how Democrats and Republicans in the United States respond to environmental
 information disseminated via social media. Lastly, there is a group of studies that explore the effects on


                                                   Esteve-del-Valle, M. / RCR, Vol. 13, No. Sp, 106-121                                         111

    deliberation that come from exposure to climate change-related information on social media. Shapiro and Park
    (2018) examine YouTube's potential to facilitate political deliberation about climate change; more recently,
    Serrano-Contreras, García-Marín, and Luengo (2020) have turned to whether exposure to a polarized climate
    change discourse on YouTube increases a user's subsequent deliberation on the topic.
         Overall, this systematic literature review suggests that the analysis of the effects of the exposure to polarized
    climate change-related discussions on social media has been met with significantly less attention than has the
    study of the nature of the communicative interactions within and between climate change-related communities on
    social media.
        Methods
         The works included in this systematic literature review employ a wide range of methodological approaches. A
    broad distinction can nonetheless be made between those that examine polarized climate change-related
    discussions on social media via the use of digital trace data (n=21) and those that investigate such discussions
    using self-reported data (n=6). Of note, none of the studies included in the review combine digital trace data and
    self-reported data.
        Studies Using Digital Trace Data
         "Digital trace data" refers to records that are generated as a result of human interaction with any kind of
    digital device (Hakimi, Eynon, & Murphy, 2021). In the papers reviewed in this study, this primarily refers to data
    generated as a result of human interaction on social media. The vast majority of the studies using digital trace
    data garnered records from Twitter (n=15), followed by YouTube (n=4). The prevalence of Twitter can be
    explained by the suitability of the platform's affordances to facilitating dialogical communications as well as the
    (previously) relatively easy access to its data through its open-source application programming interface (API)1.
    None of these studies using digital trace data combine assessments of multiple platforms, limiting the
    generalizability of their findings.
         Across the sample, social network analysis (SNA) is the most prevalent method used by the studies relying on
    digital trace data. SNA generally seeks to conceptualize social structures by focusing on the ties (represented by
    messages/comments, e.g. tweets, Reddit comments, etc.) between its nodes (e.g. individual users, organizations,
    states, etc.) on social media platforms (Otte & Rousseau, 2002). In the literature, SNA has been employed both
    exclusively and in combination with other methods. Williams et al.'s (2015) assessment of the degree of
    homophily between climate change-related communities on Twitter and Shapiro and Park's (2018) examination
    of the structure of YouTube discussions about popular climate change-related videos are two examples of its
    exclusive use. As for its combined use, Brüggemann et al. (2020) employ SNA and content analysis to identify
    patterns in hoax online discourses on climate change; Uyheng et al. (2021) characterize the polarized ecosystem of
    online climate change-related discourse via a mix of SNA and quantitative content analysis; and, Röchert et al.
    (2020) examine opinion-based homogeneity on YouTube within and between different communities regarding
    climate change via their blending of SNA and sentiment analysis.
         On the other hand, a much wider variety of methodological approaches can be observed among those studies
    that exclusively employ content analyses of polarized climate change-related discussions on social media. Several
    studies make use of quantitative and qualitative content analysis, for example, exploring sarcasm and incivility in
    Twitter discussions about climate change during an extreme-weather event (Anderson & Huntington, 2017).
    Other investigations employ topic modeling to examine the nature of the content produced by bots (Marlow et al.,
    2021). A further study combines computational and manual text-based methods (i.e. sentiment analysis and
    discourse analysis) to examine users' emotions and impressions vis-à-vis climate change-related comments on
    YouTube (Röchert et al., 2020).
        Studies Using Self-reported Data
         Within papers relying on self-reported data that were included in this study, data is primarily gathered from
    participants being asked about their social media use, their interpretation of climate change-related messages,
    and their beliefs about the phenomenon (Lavrakas, 2008). When focusing on individuals' behaviors, attitudes,
    and beliefs, self-reported data is highly suited for studies of the effects of polarized climate change-related
    discussions on social media. This is visible throughout our sample, since all the studies using self-reported data—
    with one exception (van Eck et al., 2021)—focus on the repercussions of exposure to climate change-related
    content on social media.
        Most of the studies using self-reported data make use of surveys to collect such information. Several of these
 On February 1, 2023, Twitter announced that it would no longer support free access to the platform's API. This decision is expected to have serious
consequences for researchers' future collection and analysis of Twitter-related data.

    measure how climate change-related news is received by users—by, for instance, combining responses to a survey
    and a social-learning model to test the effects of exposure to climate change-related information on participants'
    beliefs (Sikder, Smith, Vivo, & Livan, 2020), or alternatively by conducting a multilevel regression analysis to test
    social media's impacts on attitudes toward the phenomenon (Diehl et al., 2021). Another study performs a crosssectional examination of the effects of differing climate-related risk perceptions on blog consumption (van Eck et
    al., 2021); whereas Yuan and Lu (2020) break down the effects of aggressive communication styles on climaterelated behaviors through the use of structural equation modeling.
         Exceptionally, we found two studies mixing quantitative survey research with qualitative methods. Chapman
    et al. (2016) blend the use of a survey with discussion groups to investigate public perceptions of climate changerelated images in three countries. Jennings et al. (2021), meanwhile, combine a survey with cognitive map
    drawing to measure partisan responses to climate change-related video content on social media.
         In summary, as shown in Table 1, most of the publications included in this systematic literature review
    employ digital trace data (19 out of 27), while a minority use self-reported data (8 out of 27). Furthermore, those
    that use digital trace data predominantly focus on the structural characteristics of users' communicative
    interactions (18 out of 19 studies). Among these studies, SNA seems to be the preferred method to identify
    network structures, while scholars are inclined to use a wider variety of approaches when examining the content
    of polarized climate change-related discussions on social media. On the other hand, the studies using selfreported data mostly focus on the effects of exposure to polarized climate change-related discussions on social
    media (5 out of 8 studies). Among these, surveys clearly lead when it comes to the collection of data.

            Findings
        The findings of the studies assessed in this systematic literature review can be classified into three different
   categories, discerning between research: a. On the relationship between the studies' foci and the existence of
   polarized climate change-related communications on social media; b. on the relationship between the studies'
   types of data and the existence of polarized climate change-related communication on social media; and c. on the
   relationship between the studies' different forms of political polarization and the existence of polarized climate
   change-related communications on social media.
      On the Relationship between the Studies' Foci and the Existence of Polarized Climate Change-related
   Communications
        With regard to the relationship between the studies' foci and the existence of polarized climate change-related
   communications, two findings can be identified: a) based on the degree of polarization between climate changerelated communities, including the analysis of the linguistic features of polarized climate change-related
   discussions; and, b) based on the effects of the exposure to climate change-related information.
        Findings: Identifying the Degree of Polarization in Climate Change-related Communities on Social Media,
   Including the Analysis of the Linguistic Features of These Conversations
        Most of the findings revolve around measuring the degree of polarization within communicative interactions
   between opposing climate-change related communities on social media. Very often, these findings are
   contradictory: some point to users mostly interacting with like-minded individuals, while others reveal the
   existence of clear cross-community engagement. Among the first group, Williams et al. find that climate changerelated conversations on Twitter "are characterized by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into
   polarized ‘sceptic' and ‘activist' groups" (2015, p. 1). Similarly, Helmouth et al. (2016) show that such Twitterbased discussions mirror political affiliations, inducing polarization—e.g. that U.S. Senate Democrats and
   Republicans belong to two distinct and semi-isolated subnetworks here. More recently, Al-Rawi et al.'s (2021)
   study of the term "fake news" in the climate change discourse on social media reveals a clearly polarized debate,
   wherein a conservative, "skeptic" community is shown to be more engaged with the conversation than is a liberal,
   "believer" one. Similarly, Cann et al.'s (2021) analysis of information-sharing about climate change on social
   media shows that it is both polarized and politicized.
        Alternatively, Chen et al.'s (2021) study of the Finnish Twittersphere reveals that climate politics are not
   particularly polarized in this space, although the authors also point to a significant role being played by
   partisanship in the molding of users' beliefs. As for YouTube, the analysis by Röchert et al. (2020) find that
   comments on a climate change-related video have a higher likelihood of becoming connected to ideologically
   opposed comments than to ideologically aligned ones, revealing a moderate opinion-based heterogeneity. More
   generally, Diehl et al.'s (2021) research shows that an increase in news consumption via social media leads to a
   decrease in the gap between left and right, suggesting that these platforms have the potential to bring groups from
   disparate sides of the debate closer together. Be that as it may, a recurrent finding across most of these studies,


114                                      Esteve del Valle, M. / RCR, Vol. 13, No. Sp, 106-121


 one actually in line with the results presented in Figure 2 above, is that ideology and political affiliation are key to
 explaining the dissimilar degree of polarization in climate change-related conversations on social media.
      There also exists a set of findings which concentrate on the deliberative nature of social media conversations
 as well as on the topics that they embrace. Concerning the first of these, Mo Jang and Hart's (2015) early analysis
 of the climate change-related communication of users in the US who, respectively, accept or question the
 phenomenon's existence illustrates that hoax frames that call into doubt the reality of climate change are deployed
 more in "red states" than in "blue states." Along similar lines, Brüggemann et al.'s (2020) examination of the
 climate change discourse on social media reveals that hoaxes are a salient feature of online debates. These
 discourses engage with contrarian voices in mutual accusations, solidifying the exclusive identities of both groups
 and exacerbating polarization. Furthermore, Tyagi et al.'s (2020a) quantification of hostile communication
 regarding the anthropogenic causes of climate change on Twitter between believers and disbelievers shows that
 the latter's words mostly focus on attacking influencers who do believe in it. Conversely, a study of climate
 change-related discussions on Twitter by Anderson and Huntington (2017) shows that instances of incivility and
 sarcasm are modest in these discussions overall, and that incivility is often associated instead with the discussion
 of political topics.
       As for topics featuring in climate change-related conversations on social media, Pearce et al.'s (2014) research
 of the 2013 IPCC Working Group 1 report finds that most conversations studied revolve around science,
 geographical location, and social issues connected to climate change. Furthermore, their study reveals that most
 users interact with others holding similar climate change-related views to themselves. On the other hand, Arlt et
 al.'s (2019) analysis of the Twitter communities respectively supporting and opposing the Swiss "Nuclear
 Withdrawal Initiative" points to an active exchange of opinions across camps and reveals the existence of different
 prevailing topics within the conversations of each. Adding to this topical diversity, Meza et al.'s (2018, p. 1,075)
 investigation of the comments posted on YouTube about the documentary Before the Flood reveal that most of
 them concentrate on humorous aspects, on correcting other users' facts on climate change, and on discussing the
 latter's mitigation. More recently, Marlow et al.'s (2021) study of bots' Twitter activity shows that they amplify
 denialist messages about climate change by sharing news links on highly controversial topics, such as the
 announcement of US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.
      Findings Concerning the Effects of the Exposure to Climate Change-related Information on Social Media
      As previously mentioned, the findings of this second set of studies revolve around the impact of climate
 change-related information shared via social media on: (a) individual beliefs; (b) people's engagement with
 related climate-related topics on social media; and, (c) users' deliberative communication practices on social
 media. Among the first set, Samantray and Pin's (2019) assessment of Twitter conversations about climate change
 (2007–2017) finds that, over time, the evolution of homophily therein reduces polarization. In other words, there
 is a negative association between homophily, the tendency of people to communicate with others holding similar
 beliefs to oneself, and polarization. Furthermore, Diehl et al.'s (2021) evaluation of the effects of news
 consumption via social media on people's climate change-related beliefs shows that using these platforms for
 news is associated with a decrease in climate skepticism, thereby helping to bridge the ideological divide between
 skeptics and believers here.
      As for the studies on individuals' engagement with climate change-related information on social media,
 Chapman et al.'s (2016) investigation of user responses to photographic climate change-related material shared
 on social media shows that images of "solutions" are less polarizing for skeptics. Moreover, Jennings et al.'s (2021)
 study of U.S. Democrats and Republicans' reactions to environmental information distributed via social media
 finds that video messages are more persuasive and of greater utility for the former than they are for the latter.
 Lastly, with regard to the impact on individuals' climate change-related deliberative communication practices on
 social media, Shapiro and Park's (2018) examination of YouTube videos' potential to facilitate political
 deliberation concludes that the platform's discussion networks are not viable outlets for balanced political
 dialogue because, according to the authors, the debate here is driven by small groups of individuals who, at least
 half of the time, are running their own campaigns for or against climate change. Alternatively, Serrano-Contreras
 et al.'s (2020) study of participation in YouTube climate change-related videos does not reveal any "significant
 relationships suggesting that increased participation leads to increased polarization" (2020, p. 69).
      Overall and regarding a general pattern, the findings are inconclusive, with some studies pointing to intensely
 polarized forms of digital communication and others revealing some degree of cross-community interaction. As
 for the linguistic features and the topics addressed in the climate change-related conversations happening online,
 hoax frames seem to be more present in the communication of disbelievers than they are in that of believers, while
 both communities seem to build their focus around different thematic considerations. Lastly, with regard to the
 effects of exposure to climate change-related information on social media, some studies show that these online


                                       Esteve-del-Valle, M. / RCR, Vol. 13, No. Sp, 106-121                         115

platforms can help bridge the gap between believers and disbelievers, while others are more skeptical about their
potential of social media to facilitate genuine debate between the respective camps.
    Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the studies examining the presence of polarized climate
change-related communications. Specifically, it reveals that 13 identify instances of polarization, 6 report none,
and 8 remain inconclusive. Despite these disparities, a discernible correlation emerges when examining the
studies' thematic focus and the observed existence of polarization. Specifically, within the realm of
"Communicative Interactions", 12 out of 19 studies point towards instances of polarized climate change-related
communications. In contrast, only 1 out of 8 studies exploring the "Effects of Exposure to Climate-Change-related
Information" identifies such polarization. Notably, within the latter category, half of the studies (n = 4) present
inconclusive results regarding the existence of polarized climate change-related communications, with 3 studies
reporting no discernible polarization.
   On the Relationship between Different Types of Data and the Existence of Polarized Climate Change-related
Communications on Social Media
     In line with Terren and Borge's (2020) analysis, we assessed the potential relationship between the type of
data used in the studies employed in our systematic literature review and the studies' findings with regard to the
existence of polarized climate change-related communications. As shown in Table 1, our results reveal that, out of
the 21 studies employing digital trace data, 12 reveal some instances of polarized climate change-related
discussions, 5 indicate the presence of any instance, and 4 are inconclusive. As for the studies using self-reported
data (N= 6), 2 find instances of polarization, 1 none, and 3 are inconclusive. Therefore, a slight yet clear
relationship can be established between the type of data used in these publications and the studies' findings with
regard to the existence of polarized climate change-related communications.
   On the Relationship between Different Forms of Political Polarization and the Existence of Polarized Climate
Change-related Communications on Social Media
     Finally, we assessed whether there was any relationship between different forms of political polarization and
the existence of polarized climate change-related communications. To do so, we read and classified the studies
into the type of polarization we estimated they were focusing on. In doing so, we found that the publications of our
systematic literature could be classified as focusing on ideological polarization—the divergence of political
opinions, beliefs, attitudes, and stances of political adversaries (Dalton, 1987)— affective polarization —i.e. the
extent to which people like (or feel warmth towards) their political allies and dislike (or feel lack of warmth
towards) their political opponents (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012)— and elite polarization, that is, the polarization
of political elites (Robinson & Mullinix, 2016).
      As shown in Table 1, of the 27 publications included in our systematic literature review, 13 are identified as
studying ideological polarization, 12 as studying affective polarization and 2, Shapiro and Park (2018) and Meza et
al., (2018) studies on YouTube elite's influence on mobilizing climate change-related polarized communication, as
"elite polarization". Among the publications identified as approaching ideological polarization, 5 studies reveal
some instances of polarized climate change-related communications, 4 do not find any of these instances, and
another 4 are inconclusive. On the other hand, with regard to the 12 publications identified as approaching
affective polarization, 9 of these publications show instances of polarization, 2 indicate none and 1 is inconclusive.
Similarly, the two publications identified as studying elite polarization are also inconclusive with regard to the
existence of polarized climate change-related communications.
     In sum, for those publications studied in this systematic literature review, there seem to be clear relationships
between the type of political polarization analyzed in the publications and their findings with regard to the
existence of polarized climate change-related communications. More specifically, most of the publications
identified as approaching affective polarization reveal instances of polarized climate change-related
communication on social media, while most of the publications approaching ideological polarization either do not
find instances of polarization or the findings are inconclusive.


                                                  DISCUSSION

     In this article, we have offered what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first systematic literature review on
social media, political polarization, and climate change. The relatively low number of studies included in our
review (n=27) suggests that the field is still a nascent one. However, the growing number of articles published in
recent years suggests interest in the topic is rapidly increasing.
    Similar to Terren and Borge's (2020) systematic literature review of studies on social media and echo


116                                    Esteve del Valle, M. / RCR, Vol. 13, No. Sp, 106-121


 chambers, we found that most of our 27 studies (19 out of 27) focus on communicative interactions within and
 between climate change-related communities on social media; a handful of them (6 out of 27), contrariwise,
 assess the effects of exposure to climate change-related information on such platforms. Most of the analyzed
 studies also start from the assumption that polarization exists in social media discussions about climate change,
 which suggests that the literature has by now moved beyond seeking to prove the reality of such a schism. Indeed,
 the majority of these studies attempt to address the degree of such polarization and the linguistic features of the
 ensuing online exchange.
      As for the social media platforms analyzed, there seems to be a clear focus on Twitter, with others (e.g.
 Facebook and YouTube) receiving significantly less attention. This is in line with the results of prior reviews on
 the use of social media in general (Aichner et al., 2021), and on social media and political polarization in
 particular (Kubin & Sikorski, 2021). Cross-platform studies are essentially nonexistent, which undermines the
 possibility of making any (empirically-based) general claims about the state of climate change-related polarization
 on social media. This is certainly a knowledge gap that future research should consider rectifying.
      Relatedly, and despite the well-researched consequences that the affordances of social media platforms have
 on users' interactions (Bucher & Helmond, 2018), only a small number of studies included in this systematic
 literature review address the potential impact of platform-specific characteristics on polarizing climate changerelated communication. Shapiro and Park's (2018) analysis of YouTube's facilitating of deliberative
 communication regarding climate change is one example here. We believe future research should study the
 impact that social media platforms' properties can have on polarizing climate change-related conversations in
 greater detail.
      With regard to the data employed by the research output included in our systematic literature review, we
 found that most of the studies (n = 21) use digital trace data, while a minority of them (n = 6) employ selfreported data. Among those that use trace data, SNA and (qualitative and quantitative) content analyses are used
 to study the structure and content of online climate change-related communicative interactions. Among those that
 employ self-reported data, meanwhile, surveys lead as a method for data collection and statistical analyses are the
 dominant means of analysis. We could not find, however, any work analyzing both digital trace- and self-reported
 data. The significant potential arising from combining these two kinds of data should be taken into account in
 future studies. This could help overcome potential bias in both approaches (e.g. lack of information on individuals
 in the case of digital trace data and inaccuracies in self-reported data). It could also contribute to the improved
 study of both the characteristics of climate change-related interactions on social media and their effects on
 individuals, enabling a more thorough understanding of these complex issues. Stier et al.'s (2020) special issue on
 integrating survey and digital trace data can be of help here.
      The studies included in our systematic literature review yield conflicting results about the level of climate
 change-related polarization on social media, with some–13 out of 27 publications, as shown in Table 1– pointing
 to a high degree thereof (e.g. Pearce et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2015), whereas others (n = 6) either reveal the
 existence of cross-community interaction (e.g. Arlt et al., 2019; Röchert et al., 2020) or are inconclusive in this
 respect (n = 8). Despite this divergence in the studies' findings with regard to the existence of polarized climate
 change-related communications, our analysis points to clear relationships between the existence of such polarized
 communications and the foci of the publications, the types of data used in the studies, and the different forms of
 political polarization approached in the papers. As can be seen in Figure 4, the existence of polarized climate
 change-related discussions on social media clearly dominates the studies focusing on communicative interactions,
 employing digital trace data, and approaching affective polarization. Regarding the publications focused on the
 effects of exposure to climate change-related information on social media, where self-reported data is employed
 and ideological polarization is investigated, the dominant trend is either the absence of polarization or the
 presence of inconclusive results.

     Figure 4. Visualization of the Relationship between the Publications' Type of Data, Foci, and Forms of
            Polarization with the Existence of Polarized Climate Change-related Communications


     Since most of the relevant studies analyzed in this review were conducted in the context of the U.S. bipartisan
political system, where climate change is well-established as a highly contentious issue dividing Democrats and
Republicans, future research should investigate whether ideology and political affiliation are also key to
explaining polarization in climate change-related communication on social media in other two-party or multiparty
systems—or, alternatively, whether there are supplementary factors that can better explain this schism.
     Furthermore, our research focuses on a specific period when access to Twitter data was relatively easy.
However, this landscape has changed dramatically following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company, particularly
affecting researchers with limited financial resources. In light of this, we plan to conduct a systematic literature
review in the coming years to assess the impact of these changes on research in this field. This will not only
address the platforms studied but also explore shifts in research methods and data access, as our current review
suggests an interconnection between these elements.
     Although the study of climate change-related polarization on social media is still in its infancy, through this
systematic literature review, we have been able to identify similarities and differences between studies already in
existence. This allows us to paint a critical yet eloquent picture of the peer-reviewed research done to date.
Hopefully, our review provides some cohesion to a still rather fragmented field, thereby inspiring future research
on such a timely topic. We particularly encourage scholars to expand our current understanding of events on
social media by combining theoretical domains (e.g. environmental and media ones) and methodological
approaches (e.g. SNAs and surveys). Doing so could produce more nuanced insight into the multifaceted nature of
this climate change-related polarization currently playing out online.


                                                 CONCLUSION

     This systematic literature review has outlined the findings of a content analysis involving 27 peer-reviewed
scientific articles on social media, political polarization and climate change. It has revealed that most of the
studies (a) focus on communicative interactions within and between climate change-related communities on
social media, (b) specifically target Twitter, (c) employ digital trace data, and (d) yield contradictory results with
regard to degree of climate change-related polarization on social media.
     Despite the publications' divergent results concerning the existence of political polarization, our paper points
to a clear relationship between the studies' foci, type of data, and forms of polarization. Specifically, polarized
discussions on social media concerning climate change clearly overshadow studies that explore communicative
interactions, utilize digital trace data, and address affective polarization. Alternatively, in publications
investigating the effects of exposure to climate change-related information on social media, and particularly those
relying on self-reported data to examine ideological polarization, the predominant trend is either the absence of
polarization or inconclusive results.
     Our systematic literature review has also identified potential avenues for future research. First, there is a
clear need for cross-platform investigations. Second, much remains to be understood about the impact that the
affordances of social media platforms can exert on polarizing climate change-related conversations. Third, future
studies should seek innovative methodological approaches to integrate digital-trace data and self-reported data.

     Overall, and despite its limitations, this systematic literature review contributes a unique taxonomy of studies
 on social media, polarization and climate change. This offers a valuable starting point for future works to advance
 our understanding of polarized climate change-related conversations.

      Appendix 2
      As mentioned above, we used Boolean searches including exclusively the following keywords: "social media"
 AND "polarization" AND "climate change." This was a topic search identifying correspondence based on titles,
 abstracts, and keywords. We also employed a Boolean search in the database Web of Science with the keywords
 "social networks" AND "polarization" AND "climate change." This search returned eight articles. Of these, five
 tackled offline social networks exclusively, two were already included in the works yielded by our initial Boolean
 search, and one was a review of the literature. Consequently, we decided to use the Boolean search "social media"
 AND "polarization" AND "climate change."
     The list of the eight peer-reviewed publications, including authors, titles, journal, year of publication,
 databases,         and       types       of         study,        can          be         accessed        via:

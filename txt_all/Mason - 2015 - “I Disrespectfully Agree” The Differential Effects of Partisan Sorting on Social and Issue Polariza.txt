“I Disrespectfully Agree”: The Differential Effects
of Partisan Sorting on Social and Issue Polarization
Lilliana Mason              Rutgers University


      Disagreements over whether polarization exists in the mass public have confounded two separate types of polarization. When
      social polarization is separated from issue position polarization, both sides of the polarization debate can be simultaneously
      correct. Social polarization, characterized by increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger, is increasing, driven by
      partisan identity and political identity alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue position polarization.
      The partisan-ideological sorting that has occurred in recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to hold more aligned
      political identities, which has strengthened partisan identity and the activism, bias, and anger that result from strong
      identities, even though issue positions have not undergone the same degree of polarization. The result is a nation that agrees
      on many things but is bitterly divided nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong support for these hypotheses.

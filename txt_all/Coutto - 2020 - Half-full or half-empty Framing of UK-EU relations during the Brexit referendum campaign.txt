    ABSTRACT                                                                             KEYWORDS
    This article analyses the political construction and politicisation of UK–           Framing; content analysis;
    EU relations by British parliamentarians in Westminster and in the                   Brexit referendum; European
    European Parliament (EP) between May 2015 and May 2017. Using                        Union
    computer-assisted content analysis techniques and qualitative analysis
    of sampled speeches, we investigate how parties used frames and
    emotions in order to mobilise voters. Results indicate that the ‘Leave’
    campaign succeeded in triggering sentiments of distrust and anger
    against the establishment and mobilizing voters while, economic
    arguments used by ‘remainers’ failed to convince citizens from
    deprived areas of the benefits of EU membership. Intra-party divisions
    were stronger among Westminster members than in the EP, but the
    visibility of the ‘Leave’ discourse in the EP was disproportionately
    higher to the number of pro-Brexit parliamentarians. Polarisation and
    values-based arguments are observed in the EP early in the campaign,
    suggesting that the process initiated at the European level and then
    migrated to the national level.


Introduction: the construction of the ‘referendum crisis’
‘The British people have made a choice. That not only needs to be respected – but those on
the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.’ With these
words Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the result of the 2016 United Kingdom
European Union membership referendum (‘EU referendum’) and announced his resigna­
tion. The narrow victory of the Leave camp reflected a deeply divided country (Hobolt 2016):
euroscepticism became more socially distinctive and widespread (Goodwin and Heath
2016, 331), populism was encouraged and a sense of ‘ontological anxiety and insecurity’
emerged among Remain supporters (Browning 2018, 341). The referendum raised questions
about ‘British identity’ and imperial nostalgia, and brought up concerns about the relation­
ship between England, Scotland and Northern Ireland (Shannon 2015; Clarke and Newman
2017; Kenny 2017). The campaign catalysed the politicisation of UK–EU relations and
exposed the pitfalls of EU polity system, which was in turn instrumentalised by illiberal
figures in the continent. The events in the UK compromised even more the legitimacy of the
EU, which was already regarded as uncapable of addressing economic, social and security
challenges (Dinan, Nugent, and Paterson 2017; Genschel and Jachtenfuchs 2018).

Politicisation and contestation of EU (of which Brexit is an acute manifestation) brought up
the risk of the emergence of a disintegration dynamic (Rosamond 2016, 868).
    The possibility of a referendum, raised by Cameron in his Bloomberg speech in 2013,
initiated a crisis in British politics that deeply affected UK–EU relations. By ‘crisis’ we mean
a socially constructed and highly political period of instability and transition when
a decisive intervention becomes not only possible but necessary (Hay 1996: 254). The
speech opened an avenue for overt contestation of ‘common-sense’ policy prescriptions
from challenger parties (Laffan 2014, 266), exposed deep divisions within the
Conservative and Labour groups (Lynch and Whitaker 2018), and lead to a ‘drama of
accountability and blaming’ typical of moments of crisis (Boin et al. 2010, 706). UK politics
entered a state of exception and social panic that justified decisions that would not seem
feasible otherwise (Roitman 2013).
    The period between General Elections (GE) of 2015 and 2017 reflects also an European
crisis, marked by the intensification of politicisation of EU membership and polarisation of
political discourse. This context gave visibility and legitimised, to a certain extent, the
emotional populist-authoritarian rhetoric that mobilised a share of voters by bringing
together the fear of the foreigner, the anger against the elites and a ‘concrete’ alternative
to restore not only the economy but above all the national pride (Levinger 2017; Warren
2018). A similar phenomenon had been observed by Wendler (2014) when analysing
other National Parliamentary Debates on EU Treaty Reform.
    This article seeks to investigate how UK–EU relations have been framed by British
representatives in the House of Commons (HoC) and in the EP, and how these frames
relate to the increasing politicisation observed along the referendum process. We focus
on the following questions: when and how have social, economic, institutional and
security issues been used by representatives to justify their stance (leave or remain)?
How may the patterns of politicisation of these issues vary according to political party,
stance and institutional setting (Brussels or Westminster)? Finally, drawing on Atikcan
(2018) and Bennett (2019), we verify the blurring of party lines – that is, whether
representatives were loyal to their party or personal beliefs. Following Entman’s (1993)
definition of framing as a process of selection and emphasis of perceived aspects of reality
as well as on Semetko and Valkenburg (2000) typology, we identify the dominant frames
and study their evolutionary process. Furthermore, we explore the use of emotions in the
construction of UK–EU relations since they (like frames) are ‘intensifiers’ of ideas and
attitudes that may render salient aspects that would be otherwise neglected by the public
(Freeden 2013, 7). Our results confirm the hypothesis that anger, triggered mainly by ideas
of patriotism, pride and sovereignty, proved to be a more powerful driver in the refer­
endum, thus shedding light on the process through which narratives about the EU evolve
in periods of crisis.


Media and Parliamentary discourse on UK-EU relations
Political communication literature indicates that the historically embedded narrative that
opposed British interests to those of a Germany-controlled ‘Europe’ was still present in
certain political and media discourses, and particularly strong among challenger parties
and tabloid press (Semetko and Valkenburg 2000; De Vreese 2005; Daddow 2012). Press
coverage of the referendum was marked by low visibility of analysts and academics (11%


                                                   JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION        697


of the articles) and Labour politicians (17%), as opposed to the high exposure of Leave
campaigners (74%) (Levy, Aslan and Bironzo 2016). The economy was by far the most
covered issue, followed by immigration (the most prominent issue among voters) and
health (Hobolt 2016, 1262). In the week before the referendum, ‘Brexit’ and the ‘EU’ were
the subject of 77% of all newspaper articles on UK political issues (Moore and Ramsay
2017, 14). We also observe a higher visibility of migration issues, and its securitization as
freedom of movement was linked to terrorist attacks (Vasilopoulou 2016, 222).
   Poor knowledge of EU institutions coupled with the weak presence of everyday
symbols such as flags and Euro notes have limited individuals’ identification with the
Union and contributed to low public support for integration in the UK (Cram 2012; Startin
2015). The two main parties have historically approached EU politics in an ‘indirect and
potentially less electorally risky manner’ by focussing on general views rather than specific
policies (Sherrington 2006, 70), thus helping party leaders from providing clear cues to
their voters (Curtice 2015). Pro-remain politicians were careful to overtly support the EU,
while Eurosceptics of varied political leanings frequently spoke against it (Forster 2003;
Startin 2015) – a trend confirmed in Wenzl’s (2019) analysis of MPs’ speeches given in
Westminster between 2015 and 2016. As shown by Clarke, Goodwin, and Whiteley (2017),
the association of EU membership and negative emotions might have played a critical role
in the narrow victory of the Leave camp. While parliamentary debates gained visibility
during the campaign and after the referendum, analyses comparing the discursive
practices in Westminster and in the EP remain overlooked. Cross-country analyses have
shed light on patterns of politicisation and polarisation of national parliamentary debates
about the EU (Hutter and Kerscher 2014; Wendler 2014), but the specificities of each
national context limit the explanatory power of these studies. The focus on British
politicians allows us to avoid excessive variation, and to isolate the institutional setting
variable (which could not be done if we focused exclusively in one parliament). This way
we can better understand how framing and politicisation take place at different political
levels, and how these processes may interfere with each other. Finally, results allow for
further comparisons between politicians and other political actors such as the media and
lobby groups, which have been the object of various recent studies on Brexit (Zappettini
and Krzyżanowski 2019).


Framing of EU politics and policy processes
Framing influences the politics of policy-making as political participation and mobilization
depend on information received from leaders and the media (Laffan 2014). Their potential
effect on public opinion becomes particularly relevant in politically polarised contexts
where direct democracy instruments are adopted (Morel and Qvortrup 2018). Academic
works on framing of EU-related issues tend to focus on specific events such as treaty
revisions and elections (Hawkins 2015), while others compare the mobilizing effect of the
media across the EU (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2006; Schuck, Vliegenthart, and de Vreese
2016). A more recent strand investigates how elements such as public debt and the influx
of refugees are framed as crises and its impact on domestic politics (Schimmelfennig
2014; Greussing and Boomgaarden 2017; Börzel and Risse 2018). Looking at the relation­
ship between crises, public opinion and political competition, Taggart and Szczerbiak
(2018) analyse how parties use economic, migration, sovereignty/democracy and national

frames to mobilise euroscepticism and obtain political payoffs.Semetko and Valkenburg
(2000) identify five types of frames used to report European politics: conflict frames
emphasize opposition between individuals, groups or institutions and are common
during presidential elections, referenda and in ideologically driven debates (Dennison
and Geddes 2018). The human-interest frame uses individual stories with the aim of
explaining complex problems (Price, Tewksbury, and Powers 1997). Economic conse­
quences frames appeal to ‘rational decisions’ and protect the politician from being
ideologically committed to a specific policy, but has a mild mobilizing effect. The morality
frame puts events ‘in the content of religious tenets or moral prescriptions’, while the
responsibility frame links the cause or solution of a problem to specific actors (Semetko
and Valkenburg 2000, 96). The typology provides a blueprint that allows us to observe the
evolution of framing between May 2015-May 2017, and how they may relate to predo­
minant emotions in ‘leave’ and ‘remain’ discourses at national and European political
levels.


Methodology
The period analysed in this paper period is divided into three phases: (a) pre-campaign,
which began with the victory of the Conservatives on 5 May 2015 and finished on
20 February 2016, when Cameron announced the date of the referendum; (b) campaign,
from 21 February until the vote on 23 June 2016 and; (c) post-referendum, from
24 June 2016 to 5 May 2017. Our first goal is to identify the most salient topics in this
debate and when they became to be referred to as a crisis. We then analyse to what
extent framing of the referendum may vary depending on the institutional setting and
individual stance on EU membership. Using computer-assisted sentiment analysis com­
plemented with qualitative study of purposely sampled speeches, we test to what extent
the claims that the ‘Remain’ narrative fit into the archetype of ‘Project Fear’ and that it was
uncapable of making a positive case for EU membership. That is, to what extent the
‘Remain’ discourse relate to sentiments of fear and negativity. Likewise, we examine
whether the ‘Leave’ campaign has been accurately dubbed as ‘Project Anger’. Finally,
following the literature on second-order elections (Reif and Schmitt 1980; Marsh and
Mikhaylov 2010), we verify whether we see clearer cues and stronger positions in the EP
than in Westminster – a behaviour that tends to benefit challenger and radical parties.
    The quantitative part of the study seeks to identify the main issues and dominant
frames used by the main UK parties – Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats (LibDem)
and United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). For MPs serving in the HoC, we used
a public dataset of speeches collected from Hansard by Odell (2019) and stored as a CSV,
and as a tibble class in RDS files for R programming language. Our population consists of
speeches with more than fifty words made during debates and statements of all MPs
serving between 2015 and 2017 (N = 112,251 speeches). We also include the MP’s stance
during the referendum (leave or remain), which is available at publicwhip.org.uk. To
analyse the speeches made by the 74 British MEPs we used the LinkedEP dataset,
manually coded the position of each MEP in the referendum and used the package
tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016; R Core Team 2017). For the sentiment analysis, we
used the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, or EmoLex (Mohammad and Turney
2013), which maps a list of 14,000 English words into eight emotions (anger, fear,


                                                               JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION                 699


anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and
positive). For the topic analysis, we built a dictionary based on the one proposed by
FIXME, which maps a list of 176 words into 19 policy issues.
    The qualitative analysis is based on a purposive sample of speeches and statements
made by the leaders of the four main parties from May 2015 to May 2017. The selected
communications were given at the following occasions: (a) at party conferences in 2015
and 2016; (b) following the announcement of the date of the referendum on
20 February 2016; (c) following the official launching of the campaign on 16 April 2016;
(d) last speech before the polls and (e) following the result of the referendum (in total ten
speeches per party leader). For each speech, we identify the dominant issues and frames,
its tone and their view on UK–EU relations. The transcriptions were obtained from the
parties’ websites as well as from Hansard (which provides a comprehensive account of the
proceedings of the HoC), UKPOL political speech digital archive and EP website.


Results and discussion
EU affairs in Westminster and EP debates: topics and policy issues
The UK referendum has prompted discussions around EU policies, institutions and raison
d’être throughout the two-year period. Nevertheless, their visibility in the parliamentarian
debate varied considerably: unsurprisingly, elections, G7 conferences and EU Council
meetings triggered interventions concerning the EU (Figure 1). Another peak is observed
in February 2016, when Cameron spelled out his view of a ‘good deal’ for Britain that
included, inter alia, restrictions to freedom of movement and to social benefits for EU
migrants, but which had weak emotional appeal. During that period, approximately 4,000
out of 6,000 contained the term ‘EU’ or ‘European Union’ (Figure 1).

    Although ‘remainers’ from different parties accounted for most of the seats in the
Commons, we observe an increase in the proportion of ‘pro-leave’ speeches in February
and March 2016. Other peaks are observed in the run-up to the referendum, when
Theresa May became the new PM in July 2016, after the publication of the
‘Government’s “Plan for Britain” and the Notification of Withdrawal Bill’ (January 2017),
and after the dissemination of the Brexit White Paper (February 2017). The proportion of
speeches per political party follows the distribution of seats in the Parliament: 331
Conservatives, 232 Labour, 56 SNP, 8 LibDem, remaining stable when we compare the
total population (all speeches) with those that refer to the EU. Exceptions include a lower
number of EU-related interventions among Labour MPs in March 2016 (24.1% of the total
but only 18.7% of EU speeches), and an increase following the result of the referendum in
June (23.9% of the total and 29.4% of EU-related) and July 2016 (26.2% and 34.2%,
respectively). ‘Remainers’ were the main contributors to the discussions, which reflected
MPs’ positions (479 votes against 158). However, pro-leave MPs were more vocal after
specific events such as EU Council meetings, when potential friction with the EU became
evident. Communications that evoked a ‘soft Brexit’, a second referendum or no Brexit at
all triggered harsh declarations from ‘leavers’ and pushed the government to reiterate
their ‘trust in the British people’ as there was no opt-out from Brexit, as stated by the PM at
the party conference on 2 October 2016.
    A different dynamic is observed among the 73 British Brussels-based MEPs due to the
fewer number of speeches, party diversity and presence of the radical right. The 2015
election did not have affect the number of speeches, which were predominantly proremain at that time. On the other hand, the refugee crisis fostered a more active
participation of UKIP members in the debate. Their discourse was characterised by
short, percussive and anger-provoking interventions that appealed to national pride
and securitised of migration – which in turn was not distinguished from asylum. We
observe a combination of conflict (us versus them) and responsibility frames, where the EU
is described as uncapable of protecting Europeans from a ‘flow of biblical proportions’ of
migrants and terrorists (Farage, 09/09/2015). On the top of that, common policies per­
ceived as ‘unfair’ or inefficient such as agriculture as fisheries were heavily criticized by
‘leavers’ in the EP (but less so in HoC speeches about the EU (Figure 3)) and skilfully linked
to the deterioration of ‘British values’ and way of life.
    The 2015–2017 period is also marked by strong polarisation in the EP, where UKIP and
Labour (which adopted a unanimous and unequivocal position against Brexit) dominated
the debate. Labour MEPs, for example, praised the European imprint on environmental
policy, protection of civil rights and energy provision (Figure 3). Intra-party cleavages are
observed exclusively among the Conservatives, who paid a modest contribution to EP
debates: on average, 12.7% of the speeches, compared to Labour (36.7%) and UKIP
(40.2%). The sentiment analysis indicates that parliamentarians in both Westminster and
Brussels adopted and overall positive tone in their speeches, and that this trend remained
stable after the referendum (Figure 2). In line with the literature on populism and Brexit
(Rico, Guinjoan, and Anduiza 2017; Vasilopoulou and Wagner 2017), pro-leave MPs’
speeches tended to be more associated with anger than pro-remain ones, most notably
in the EP, thereby confirming the ‘project anger hypothesis’.
    Looking at the ensemble of speeches given in Westminster, we see that pro-remain
MPs failed to adopt a significantly positive tone compared to ‘leavers’ (Figure 2). This

phenomenon might be due to the fact that most of these parliamentarians were in the
opposition. The politicisation of housing and health crises provided an alternative political
narrative to the austerity policies; however, in prioritising opposition to the Conservative
party rather than EU membership, Labour provided arguments that reinforced the rela­
tionship between the EU and the degradation of life standards, thereby providing fuel for
the ‘leave’ campaign. Before the referendum, ‘Remainers’ in the HoC adopted a more

negative discourse when only the speeches related to the EU are considered, which
confirms the argument that the ‘Remain’ campaign did not make a positive case for
Britain’s EU membership (Figure 2). Particularly interesting is the stark difference between
the tone of Labour representatives in the EP, which was clearly more positive along the
whole period studied.
    The dictionary-based topic analysis of Westminster speeches confirms that pro-remain
MPs focused predominantly on pragmatic arguments (‘we are better in the EU than out’)
and on macroeconomic and commercial indicators (GDP, trade with the EU) that did not
reflect the social and economic disparities across the UK. We also observe a more
pronounced emphasis on social agendas such as housing, health, employment, among
remainers, although this might be due to the fact that these are issues traditionally
championed by the left (Labour, SNP, Greens). Pro-leave MPs, by contrast, tended to
focus more on agendas associated with the right such as law/crime and defence. They
were also more vocal to link trade to the idea of a global Britain that would ‘forge bold
new trade deals with growing economies’ (Johnson 2016a). They were also keener to raise
issues related to agriculture (although this topic was marginal in HoC debates) and
‘traditional industries such as fishing, which had been devastated by the EU’ (Shannon
2015). These trends remained unchanged after the referendum except for welfare and
finance/banking, where we see a higher number of speeches from pro-remain MPs.
Equally important is the low number of speeches containing the terms ‘migrant’, ‘refugee’
and ‘asylum seeker’, which suggests a dichotomy between parliamentary and campaign
discourses.
    In the EP, speeches made by pro-remain British MEPs focused predominantly on a wide
array of areas such as science/research, environmental protection, energy, education and
agriculture. They also stressed workers’ rights such as the working time and posted
workers directives, and civil rights established under EU legal framework. Security
mechanisms such as intelligence sharing and the European Arrest Warrant (Dance 26/
11/2015) were also frequently mentioned among remain supporters from various political
traditions. Pro-leave MEPs, by contrast, referred much more frequently to individuals such
as Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, as well as to
EU institutions (most notably the Commission, the ECB and the ECJ). Both ‘leavers’ and
‘remainers’ talked about trade in their speeches (Figure 4), but the latter emphasised the
importance of the single market while pro-leave portrayed Brexit as an opportunity for
a more global Britain. After the referendum – as the need to negotiate the terms of UK’s
withdrawal from the EU became of evident – trade became more present in the speeches
of pro-remain MEPs, which increased the visibility of this policy area (Figure 4).


A more nuanced picture: qualitative insights
Pre-campaign phase
The period between the 2015 Election and the definition of the date of the referendum –
described by former LibDem leader Nick Clegg as the victory of ‘fear and grievance’ over
liberalism (Clegg 08/05/2015) – was marked by a high degree of uncertainty around the
evolution of UK–EU relations. In his first speech after the scrutiny, Cameron praised his
government as responsible for adopting fiscal discipline, avoiding a major economic crisis
and devolving powers to the regions. The discourse mentioned job opportunities, child


                                                                   JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION                          703

care and tax cuts in order to ‘help 30 m people cope with the cost of living’, but did not
appeal to voters’ emotions, on the contrary: in deprived areas the speech reinforced the
conflict between ‘ordinary people’ and the cosmopolitan elite keen on freedom of move­
ment and the EU. The speech was predominantly inward-oriented and had no reference
to foreign policy. Notwithstanding, the PM confirms the organization of ‘that in-out
referendum’, without however providing further details about it (Cameron 08/05/2015).
By creating such unstable ground, Cameron encouraged the emergence of alternatives
for UK–EU relations that had not been an option so far. We consider this moment as the
crystallization of the referendum as a crisis.
   While the Downing Street speech contained no reference to security issues, the
politicisation of migration and increasing popularity of the UKIP (12.4% of the vote,
compared to 3.1% in 2010) provided ammunition to hard-eurosceptic conservatives,
who pressured Cameron to include further restrictions to the freedom of movement in
the negotiations with the EU (Dennison and Goodwin 2015). In the months that followed
the election, stricter border controls and cuts on migrants’ benefits were a central element
of a comprehensive strategy to provide ‘decent homes, better childcare, controlled
immigration and lower taxes’ to British families (Cameron 06/10/2015).
   This phase was marked by a significant incidence of conflict frame, as expressed in
Cameron’s promise to ‘battle’ for a good deal for Britain, and ‘a fair fight over the
referendum’ (The Guardian 16/12/2015). A significant number of Conservative and
Labour politicians choose not to declare their position, which prevented an unambiguous
pro-EU narrative from emerging and countering the conflict frame. Minority parties, by
contrast – most notably UKIP and the SNP gained visibility due to their capacity to deliver
clear cues to voters. To the latter, the referendum was also an opportunity to present

Cameron as irresponsible for playing ‘fast and loose with our place in Europe’, to confirm
SNP’s commitment to independence, and make the positive case for ‘Scotland, and the U.
K, to stay in the EU.’ (Sturgeon 17/10/2015). Early and clear support for remaining part of
the ‘European project’ was promptly publicized by the LibDems, Greens and Sinn Féin.
These parties used emotional cues and positive language to encourage the ‘remain vote’,
but they were in large part appealing to a cosmopolitan elite rather than the ‘real people’
that are penalized by delocalization, ‘excessive’ migration and a changing country where
they no longer seem to fit.
    The analysis of the selected speeches shows conflict and responsibility as the most
frequently used frames, as predicted by Semetko and Valkenburg (2000), although its use
varied according to the political party. Cameron pictured himself as the responsible for
a solution to the allegedly excessive intrusion of the EU in British politics. UKIP and hard
eurosceptics blamed the EU for erosion of national sovereignty, thus triggering a more
visceral response from voters who felt ‘left behind’ and mobilising citizens who had never
engaged with the electoral process. Responsibility and conflict frames were frequently
used by Labour and SNP to attack the Conservatives, which hampered the emergence of
a cohesive ‘remain’ narrative. The economic consequences frame is used by all pro-remain
MPs, although more frequently by both europhile and soft eurosceptic conservatives. This
frame was used in negative campaigning against pro-remain groups, labelled as ‘project
fear’ by brexiteers (The Telegraph 25/01/2016). The sentiment analysis confirms previous
findings (Mckenzie 2017) of a predominantly negative tone of leavers’ Westminster
speeches and their association to emotions such as anger and sadness in the months
that preceded the referendum.

The campaign
The campaign phase was marked by further information about Cameron’s negotiated
deal, but also by the realization that Brussels not willing to negotiate on restrictions of the
four freedoms spelled out in the Treaty (goods, capital, services, people). The conflict
frame used by the PM backfired as it became clear that he had lost not only ‘battle’ against
the EU but also the trust of the electorate. In Westminster, Labour and Conservatives
relied on utilitarian arguments an economic consequences frame, which have a weak
mobilization capacity since they lack emotional appeal. Following the strategy used in the
Scottish referendum in 2014, Conservatives’ speeches stressed the severe crises that
would arise in case of Brexit. The importance of preserving the status quo was clearly
evoked by the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is his Ryanair speech, when
he compared leaving the EU to ‘a one-way ticket to a poorer country’ according to ‘the
IMF, the OECD, to hundreds of economists’ (Osborne 2016). This strategy proved proble­
matic since aggregate economic indicators are not a convincing threat, and also because
of the stigmatization of poverty.
    Anti-Brexit partisans sought to forge a coherent and cohesive position within each
party, but inter-party coordination was quite weak. While we observe a stronger and
passionate case for remain among the centre-left, clear cues from the Labour party
leadership were not observed until two months prior to the referendum. This aspect,
coupled with the absence of individual stories capable of giving a ‘human face’ to the
remain campaign reinforced the image of the EU as an elite-driven entity disconnected
from the reality of ordinary men and women (proudly describe by Farage as ‘the little


                                                    JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION         705


people’). As the date of the referendum approached, we see a clear change in the tone of
Corbyn’s discourse and a strong emphasis on ‘social Europe’. Examples such as social and
worker’s rights (maternity leave, limitation of working time and rights of posted workers)
guaranteed by EU legislation and benefits granted by member states such as discounted
electricity charges in Denmark, Germany and Portugal become more visible in Labour
speeches (Corbyn 16/06/2016). Notwithstanding, Corbyn remained critical of the EU,
regarded as an institution the British should change from within, which confused his
voters and weakened the Labour case for remaining in the EU.
    During the campaign the LibDems stressed that ‘the referendum was not only about
the economy’, but also about the liberal legacy that would be left for future generations
(Farron, 11/05/2016). Thanks to their unambiguous position regarding EU membership,
the party was also in a better position to openly criticize the use of false information by
the ‘leave’ campaign and the absence of policy guidelines to manage Brexit (Farron, 06/
06/2016). Both LibDem and Labour discourses insisted on the conflict frame. The former,
however, stressed the opposition between remainers – who personified liberal values of
tolerance and freedom – and nostalgic leavers. Labour, by contrast, used the conflict
frame to oppose their views of social justice to the Conservatives’ focus on austerity. Once
again, the lack of a coordinated message confused voters and obscured the benefits of EU
membership.
    The Leave campaign was led by many voices, but one same message: that leaving the
EU would allow the UK to prosper again and to offer a better future for its citizens. Brexit
was framed as an act that would unleash Britain’s ‘tremendous untapped potential’ (Gove
19/04/2016) and to ‘set ourselves free from an organization that only serves its own
interests’ (Stuart 13/04/2016).
    Pro-leave politicians regardless of political leaning politicized the difficulties faced by
public services, thus jumping on the bandwagon of a crises narrative that had been
fuelled by the Labour party since 2010. Responsibility for such a situation was attributed
to an external enemy: the EU and the elites who benefit from it. Stuart’s claim that Brexit
would restore UK’s public services by investing the ‘£350 m paid to Brussels every week in
schools, the NHS, the environment, and cutting the deficit’ was frontally attacked by
LibDem and Greens leaders Tim Farron and Nathalie Bennett (06/06/2016) in a cross-party
rally in London. However, an equally strong counter narrative capable of giving hope to
those who heavily depend on public services did not emerge.

Post-referendum
Despite the earlier claim that a vote for leave would be a ‘leap in the dark’, Cameron
described the referendum as ‘a gigantic democratic exercise’ in a country where ‘we trust
people with big decisions’ (Cameron, 24/06/2016). His discourse sought above all to
‘unframe’ the crisis that had taken hold of UK–EU relations during the campaign by
underscoring Britain’s economic health reassuring financial markets and citizens affected
by Brexit. Different from Cameron’s speeches, Theresa May used morality frame to
promote the idea of solidarity based on the ‘spirit of citizenship’ that would make Brexit
work for everyone, and not for an elite that shared more values with Brussels (‘citizens of
nowhere’) than with ordinary fellow citizens (May 05/10/2016). There seems to be,
however, an instrumental use of the morality frame as a means to divert attention from
two irreconcilable needs: to ‘give British companies freedom to operate within the single


706      T. COUTTO


market’ while regulating migration and rejecting the jurisdiction of the European Court of
Justice. This narrative reflected the perception that the EU would not survive another crisis
of that proportion after the situation in the Eurozone and the impasse on the asylum
system and migration quotas, which would give the UK bargaining power.
   Following the ‘seismic result’ of the referendum, Farage (28/06/2016) praised ‘the little
people’ that were capable to stand up against the establishment and sought to claim
ownership for the outcome. Shortly after the referendum Farage quit the leadership of the
UKIP (which he left in 2018) and reinvented himself as people’s watchdog for the UK–EU
negotiation process. In the EP debates became more polarized as pro-EU members
emphasize common values and regional identities to make a passionate (and visible)
case for EU membership and ‘begging’ the EU not to let them down (Smith, 28/06/2016).
The referendum also provided an opportunity for a brief return of the LibDems to the
political scene, where they openly criticized the campaign based on ‘statistics and bully­
ing’, and sought to re-establish themselves as ‘free market, free trade pro-business’, and
the only one real opposition party (Farron 20/09/2016). Corbyn also sought to reinvent
itself as a watchdog of negotiations in order to ensure that they ‘deliver the protections
our country needs’ (Corbyn 25/06/2016). While admitting that the campaign failed to
convince ‘millions of natural labour voters who feel left behind’, the tone, subject and
framing of the discourse did not change as the Tories were framed as the main ‘respon­
sible for mismanagement of the state, rising inequality, housing crisis, people earning less
than the living wage and for demonizing migrants.’ (Corbyn 28/09/2016).


Conclusions
While the origin of the ‘referendum crisis’ dates back to 2013, it was not before the 2015
election that leaving the EU emerged as a possible (and, to some actors, desirable) event,
thus becoming the object of intense political debate. The analysis confirms the use of
framing public policy issues such as healthcare and housing as crises with the aim of
holding mainstream parties (and in particular individual politicians) accountable for the
dismantling of a fictional and idealized British way of life. Such tactic was successful in
changing the levels of political support for the status quo, in line with the studies carried
out by Boin,’t Hart, and McConnell (2009). The victory of the Leave campaign became
possible once the public acknowledged the existence of a crisis of the state and under­
stood it as stemming from the interference of technocratic, supranational (therefore
undemocratic) bodies on British sovereignty.
   In line with previous works about media coverage of the referendum and campaign
materials, we observe that the leavers and remainers organizations succeeded in shaping
the referendum agenda, which focused predominantly on economic and migrationrelated topics (Oliver 2017). We note, however, that the speeches made by ‘leave’
politicians avoided explicit references to ‘migration’ in order to avoid any explicit associa­
tion between Brexit and racism that could discourage moderate voters. By contrast, crime,
the lack of opportunities in the job market and degradation of public services (most
notably health care) were integral part of the framing of UK–EU relations, and frequently
associated to agendas supported by the Remain camp such as free trade and austerity.
The emphasis on the economic consequences frame by the Remain camp proved insuffi­
cient to mobilize part of the population which already suffered economic hardship and


                                                    JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION        707


social deprivation, and who traditionally does not engage with politics via elections. There
was no emotional response and little identification between those who felt left behind
and pro-remain arguments, even when they were made by left-wing leaders.
   The analysis confirms the incidence of ‘second order effects’ on the referendum (Reif
and Schmitt 1980; Marsh and Mikhaylov 2010). In fact, we observe clearer stances,
stronger polarisation and higher levels of party cohesiveness in the EP than
n Westminster. Challenger personalities (rather than just parties) occupied the European
political space more efficiently: while only 32 out of the 72 British MEPs were in favor of
Brexit, they delivered the majority of the speeches during the referendum campaign. They
were also capable of sending clear cues and poignant messages advocating anti-systemic
voting as a means to achieve a better future. While proportional use of the time is
observed in Westminster, pro-EU arguments had already been weakened by the incor­
poration of ‘soft Eurosceptic’ discourse into the mainstream political narrative (De Vries
and Edwards 2009). On top of that, arguments based on aggregate statistics failed to
establish emotional bonds between the people and the EU, and proved innocuous to
counter the popular rejection to Cameron himself.
   The politicisation of the eurozone and migrant/refugee crisis has not resulted in
a constructive debate about the need to reform citizens’ representation and the relations
between the UK and the EU. By promoting political polarisation, challenger parties wea­
kened the political center, which remains a space where they are not capable of operating.
The deeply rooted narrative that frames UK–EU relations as a zero-sum game was essential
to the development of the crisis fame and to the construction a straight-forward discourse
that blamed European liberal values (expressed in the idea of the four freedoms) for the
increasing insecurity experienced by the British people. The crisis discourse had arguably
controversial statements capable of triggering anger and fear, but at the same time offered
an alternative (and therefore hope). The process of framing the EU as an opponent and as
the source of a deep malaise contributed to the emergence of ‘a peculiar form of a socially
constructed utopia’ where an idealized past was projected into the future and became
possible through a vote to leave the EU (Wellings and Gifford 2018; Krzyżanowski 2019, 468).
   The process that resulted in the UK exit from the EU can be regarded as an uncoordi­
nated attempt of mainstream parties to deal with polarisation and to find alternative ways
to counter the rise of populism and its promise of delivering ‘policies that really work’. The
referendum set the context for a fierce electoral campaign (as seen in presidential
systems) that limited the power of parliamentarian debate in shaping voters’ decisions.
Put shortly, we observe second-order effects in a poll of utmost importance for British and
European politics that will have significant and long-lasting effects on British and EU
politics. Once this dynamic was set in motion, parties had no choice but to support the
decision of ‘the British people’. The use of economic (‘rational’) arguments failed to
counter the narrative that associated the EU to inequality and lack of opportunity,
which is the reality of numerous constituencies in the UK. In these areas, crisis politicisa­
tion and the absence of an ideology-based case for the EU angered (and mobilised) voters
who felt ‘felt behind’ and proved critical to the narrow victory of the ‘Leave’ camp.

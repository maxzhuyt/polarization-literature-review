Fear and Loathing across Party Lines: New Evidence
on Group Polarization
Shanto Iyengar Stanford University
Sean J. Westwood Princeton University

      When defined in terms of social identity and affect toward copartisans and opposing partisans, the polarization of the
      American electorate has dramatically increased. We document the scope and consequences of affective polarization of
      partisans using implicit, explicit, and behavioral indicators. Our evidence demonstrates that hostile feelings for the opposing
      party are ingrained or automatic in voters’ minds, and that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as
      polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors.
      Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race. We note
      that the willingness of partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be attributed to the absence of norms
      governing the expression of negative sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for elites to engage
      in confrontation rather than cooperation.

  ABSTRACT Social media analysis is a fast growing research area aimed at extracting useful information
  from social media platforms. This paper presents a methodology, called IOM-NN (Iterative Opinion Mining
  using Neural Networks), for discovering the polarization of social media users during election campaigns
  characterized by the competition of political factions. The methodology uses an automatic incremental
  procedure based on feed-forward neural networks for analyzing the posts published by social media users.
  Starting from a limited set of classification rules, created from a small subset of hashtags that are notoriously
  in favor of specific factions, the methodology iteratively generates new classification rules. Such rules are
  then used to determine the polarization of people towards a faction. The methodology has been assessed
  on two case studies that analyze the polarization of a large number of Twitter users during the 2018 Italian
  general election and 2016 US presidential election. The achieved results are very close to the real ones and
  more accurate than the average of the opinion polls, revealing the high accuracy and effectiveness of the
  proposed approach. Moreover, our approach has been compared to the most relevant techniques used in the
  literature (sentiment analysis with NLP, adaptive sentiment analysis, emoji- and hashtag- based polarization)
  by achieving the best accuracy in estimating the polarization of social media users.

techniques require the use of specific data that represents the
social network structure, which is often visualized through
graphs or sociograms. In our study, we collected and analyzed
tweets containing specific keywords or hashtags on the political event under analysis, without capturing the structure of
the related social network. For this reason, in this paper we
cannot make a comparison with network-based techniques.
   Some studies highlighted the issues related to the use of
social media data for predicting the outcome of political
events, which are language barrier, misclassification, data
imbalance and reliability [10]. During the design of IOM-NN
we faced such issues by proposing the following solutions:

At each iteration, such rules are inferred by exploiting the
posts that have been classified at the previous iterations. In the
following of this section, we discuss in detail the code of
Algorithm 1.
   The algorithm initializes an empty set C 0 for storing the
classified posts and builds a classification model M 0 based
on the positive faction keywords KF⊕ (lines 1-2). The model
defines a set of rules for calculating a binary vector vb ,
where vb [i] is 1 if p contains at least one keyword from Kfi⊕ ,
0 otherwise. The algorithm iterates (lines 3-7) on each post p
in P performing the following operations:
   - classifies p using M 0 , which produces a vector vb
      (line 4);
   - if p is in favor of a single faction f (lines 5-6), the classified post (i.e., a pair hp, f i) is added to C 0 (line 7).                   FIGURE 3. Example of the classification of posts algorithm terminating in

   At the end of iteration 0, the set of classified posts C 0
is stored in C (line 8). The set of unclassified posts (N 0 )
is obtained as the difference between P and C 0 (lines 9).                           posts (N 0 ) respectively. At iteration 1, a new model M 1 is

2) POLARIZATION OF USERS AND FINAL RESULTS
The algorithm described in Section III-C has been used for
analyzing the users who have written the 23,997 classified
tweets so as to determine their polarization degree towards
the considered factions. The first three rows of Table 4
shows a comparison between the official results, the average
of the latest polls and the percentages obtained by IOMNN. We evaluated the accuracy through different statistical indexes, comparing the obtained results with the latest
opinion polls published before the elections. Considering the
four most supported parties, our methodology obtained the
following approval percentages: M5S 31.64%, PD 19.89%,
LEGA 18.45%, and FI 12.80%. These results are extremely
close to the real ones (i.e., M5S 32.68%, PD 18.72%, LEGA
17.37%, FI 14.01%), even more than the average of polls.                        FIGURE 5. Comparison among real percentages, opinions polls and

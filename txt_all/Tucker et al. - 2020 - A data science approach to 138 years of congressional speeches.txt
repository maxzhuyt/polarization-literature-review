    Previous approaches to analyzing trends in the US Congressional
Record using automation have focused on features designed speciﬁcally
for legislative speeches. Quinn et al. (2006) examined the probability
of speeches to be related to a given legislative topic between 1997 and
2005. Their analysis provided clear descriptions of the length of debate on various issues (Quinn et al., 2010). Another method of analysis
sought to measure changes in partisanship over time based on the association bigrams with a political party (Gentzkow et al., 2019). The study
determined that partisanship remained stable from 1873 until 1994,
after which an increase in partisanship of congressional speeches was
identiﬁed (Gentzkow et al., 2019). Yu (2013) used computational methods to show gender diﬀerences between congressional speeches of male
and female legislators between the years of 1989 and 2008. Analysis of
the frequency of congressional speeches in the 103rd (1993-1994) and
109th (2005-2006) congresses showed that female legislators speak at
higher rate than male legislators (Pearson and Dancey, 2011). Yu et al.               Fig. 1. The number of congressional speeches in diﬀerent decades.

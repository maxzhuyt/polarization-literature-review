THE POLLS—REVIEW
MASS POLARIZATION: MANIFESTATIONS AND
MEASUREMENTS


                                                                                                                                YPHTACH LELKES*


         Abstract The debate on mass polarization is itself polarized. Some
         argue that the United States is in the midst of a culture war; others argue
         that the claims are exaggerated. As polarization is a multifaceted concept,
         both sides can be correct. I review four distinct manifestations of polarization that have appeared in the public opinion literature—ideological
         consistency, ideological divergence, perceived polarization, and affective
         polarization—and discuss ways in which each has been measured. Then,
         using longitudinal data from the American National Election Studies
         (ANES), I update past analyses in order to more clearly show the ways
         in which Americans have or have not polarized: Americans at the mass
         level have not diverged, nor have they become more consistent ideologically, but partisans have; perceptions of polarization have increased, but
         this change is driven by partisans, who increasingly dislike one another.


Ask a pundit or journalist if America is polarized, and you might be chided
for asking an obvious question. After Pew (2014, 6) released a report that
purported to show that “Republicans and Democrats are more divided along
ideological lines ... than at any point in the last two decades,” Vox’s Ezra Klein
(2014) dismissed the report’s punchline as a non-finding: “(E)veryone already
knew that.” However, many political scientists were not so sure, and disagreed
that the Pew findings (or any other) were indicative of a polarized public (e.g.,
Fiorina 2014; Dickinson 2015).
   Much of the disagreement between journalists and (some) political scientists over polarization comes down to varied definitions. Pew focused on
polarization as ideological consistency, while in their reaction to the report,

Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                                       393


Fiorina and Dickinson defined polarization as ideological divergence. Both of
these, I argue, are distinct manifestations of polarization. Since media outlets
often do not clearly operationalize the concept when writing about polarization, the casual observer or even political pundit could be forgiven for misunderstanding the current state of affairs. The situation is further confused when
outlets cite election outcomes, such as the red state/blue state narrative, as
evidence of polarization (see Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope [2005]; Levendusky
and Pope [2011] for critiques).
   To clear up this confusion, I review four distinct manifestations of polarization that have appeared in the public opinion literature—ideological
consistency, ideological divergence, perceived polarization, and affective
polarization—and discuss ways in which each has been measured. While
some, most prominently Fiorina, Levendusky, and co-authors, may argue
that consistency and its component—sorting—are distinct from polarization,
both can increase political tension,1 and therefore fit into the overall typology
(DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson 1996; Noel 2014).
   Polarization is often discussed as both a state and a trend. In this paper,
I focus on the latter, and therefore utilize longitudinal data to illustrate the
extent to which the mass public has polarized over time. Given space limitations, I focus on two sets of groups—the mass public and partisans.2 Although
these groups are the primary focus of the polarization literature, other groups
are often compared, for example the politically engaged versus the unengaged
(e.g., Abramowitz 2010) and the religious versus secular (e.g., Baker 2005).
   If we refocus the debate from the umbrella term—polarization—to its
components, we more clearly understand the ways in which Americans have
become polarized: Americans at the mass level have not become more consistent ideologically, nor have they diverged, but partisans have; perceptions of
polarization have increased among partisans; and partisans increasingly dislike one another.


Ideological Polarization
Perhaps the most prominent work in the polarization literature involves a
debate between Alan Abramowitz and Kyle Saunders (Abramowitz and
Saunders 2005, 2008; Abramowitz 2010) on the one side, and Morris Fiorina,
Samuel Abrams, Jeremy Pope, and Matthew Levendusky (e.g., Fiorina,
Abrams, and Pope 2005; Fiorina and Levendusky 2006a; Fiorina and Abrams


1. For instance, Mason (2015) finds that the sorted individuals exhibit higher levels of interparty
hostility and bias.
2. By mass partisans, I mean all Americans, regardless of partisan preferences and political
engagement. Partisans refers to those who, in surveys, identify with the Republican or Democratic
parties. As is typical, I include partisan leaners in this definition (Keith et al. 1992).


394                                                                        Lelkes


2008; Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2008) on the other. Relying on one set of
measures, the former group believes that America is in the midst of a culture
war; relying on another set of measures, the latter believes that claims of a culture war are exaggerated. Because the groups define polarization differently,
the debate seems to go in circles.
   With a more nuanced definition of ideological polarization, there is evidence in favor of both camps’ arguments. On the one hand, polarization can
be defined as alignment, which refers to the degree to which party identity
increasingly matches ideology (sorting) and the degree to which attitudes
become more internally consistent (see also Hill and Tausanovitch [2015]).
On the other hand, polarization has been defined as divergence or the degree
to which the distribution of ideology has moved apart. To Abramowitz and
Saunders, polarization is consistency, while to Fiorina and colleagues, polarization is divergence.

Ideological Consistency
The Pew Report (2014) that purported to show increased polarization relied
heavily on Abramowitz and Saunders’s (2005) measure and operationalization
of polarization. To these authors, it’s not necessarily the degree of ideological difference that matters so much as the degree to which people consistently align themselves with one side or another. As Baldassarri and Gelman
(2008, 409) put it, “political polarization constitutes a threat to the extent that
it induces alignment along multiple lines of potential conflict and organizes
individuals and groups around exclusive identities, thus crystallizing interests
into opposite factions.” By this definition, consistency consists of two components: sorting, or the degree to which ideology matches identity, and constraint, or the correlation between issue positions.
   To measure ideological alignment, Abramowitz (2010), Abramowitz and
Saunders (2008), and the Pew Research Center (2014) primarily rely on an
issue consistency scale. These authors take policy items that have appeared in
a number of waves of either the ANES or Pew surveys, and trichotomize them
to indicate the liberal position (coded -–1), the conservative position (coded
1), or the moderate/no-opinion position (coded 0). They then sum across items
to form a 15-point consistency index (–7 indicates that a respondent gave a
liberal response to all items; 7 indicates that a respondent gave a conservative
response to all items). Using this scale, these authors find that scores on this
scale have polarized over time, as indicated by higher standard deviations and
increased bimodality. This increase has been slight among non-voters (6 percent increase between 1984 and 2004) and fairly large among the politically
engaged (~25 percent increase; Abramowitz 2010).
   This measure has been criticized for exaggerating polarization, however
(Fiorina and Levendusky 2006b, 96–97), as the trichotomization of the 7-point
scales equates those that are slightly liberal (or conservative) with those that


Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                                395


are extremely liberal (or conservative). Baldassarri and Gelman (2008) offer
an alternative way of analyzing consistency using the same data, and come to
different conclusions. They calculate correlations between forty-seven issues


                                                                                               asked in the ANES between 1972 and 2004 (yielding 1,081 issue-pairs).
They find that issue consistency has barely budged—correlations increased
by roughly .06 points over thirty years. This modest increase applies both to
correlations between items in the same domain (e.g., two questions about economic attitudes) and to correlations between items in different domains (e.g.,
a question about economic attitudes and a question about moral attitudes).3
Issue consistency has grown, however, among strong partisans (Abramowitz
and Saunders 2008; Baldassarri and Gelman 2008; Hare and Poole 2014).
   While findings in favor of increased issue alignment among the mass public
are mixed, scholars in both camps agree that alignment between party identity
and issue attitudes has increased, a phenomenon that has been labeled sorting
(Levendusky 2009). One of the ways in which these scholars have shown evidence in favor of sorting is by looking at the correlation between the 7-point
party identity measure and the ideological self-placement measure.4 This correlation has doubled from 1972 to 2012: from r = .28 in 1972 to r = .58 by
2012, if we look at the ANES. Similarly, scholars have calculated the proportion of partisans that align their party identity with their self-reported ideology. Here as well, sorting has increased substantially over the past forty years
(from 39 percent sorted in 1972 to 57 percent sorted in 2012).
   Researchers have also shown an increased correlation between party identification and a variety of issues (Fiorina and Levendusky 2006b; Baldassarri
and Gelman 2008; Levendusky 2009; Abramowitz 2010). Baldassarri and
Gelman (2008), for instance, find that the average correlations between issues
and party identification have increased by roughly .05 per decade. Sorting
has increased the most on moral issues over the past four decades, although
it should be noted that the relationship between economic issues and partisan
identification has always been stronger than that of moral issues and partisan
identification.


Ideological Divergence
Fiorina, Levendusky, and colleagues believe that changes in sorting and constraint are categorically different phenomena with potentially different roots
than polarization. Much of the evidence against ideological divergence (in the
mass public) utilizes the 7-point liberal–conservative scale. To Fiorina and
colleagues, the mass public is polarized if the distribution of responses on this
scale is bimodal (a feature that they eyeball).

3. Like Abramowitz (2010), they also find that consistency has increased primarily among the
politically engaged.

396                                                                                          Lelkes


   I update Fiorina’s analysis by formally assessing bimodality over time. To
assess whether the distribution of responses to this measure have diverged,
I use the ANES Time Series Cumulative data file (1972–2012)5 and calculate


                                                                                                         the bimodality coefficient (BC) (Freeman and Dale 2013; Pfister et al. 2013) of
the liberal–conservative measure for each year. This measure is calculated as

                                                 m32 + 1
                                BC =                            ,
                                                     (n − 1)2                                     (1)
                                        m4 + 3 ⋅
                                                 (n − 2) (n − 3) 

where m3 refers to the skewness of the distribution, m4 refers to its excess
kurtosis, and n is the sample size. A BC of 1 indicates that a distribution is
completely bimodal, and a BC of 0 indicates that the distribution is completely
unimodal. A BC greater than .56 can be categorized as bimodal. In the appendix, I simulate two distributions, one that is unimodal (BC = .33) and one that
is just above the threshold (BC = .57; figure A1).
   In the top panel of figure 1, I plot the BC from the ANES data over time
(solid line); the horizontal line indicates the value of which we can consider
a distribution bimodal. While no time point crosses the threshold, there is a
march toward bimodality and, therefore, polarization. In 1972 the BC was .27,
and by 2012 the BC had increased to .38. Regardless, at all points in time, the
distribution of responses to this measure is clearly unimodal.
   While the BC can be used to assess polarization in the mass electorate,
it cannot be used to test divergence between two groups. Comparing means
may be misleading, as ideological consistency can lead to significant mean
differences (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008). A better indicator is the degree of
overlap—or common ground—between two groups. To measure the degree
of overlap between Democrats and Republicans on the ideological self-placement measure, I follow Levendusky and Pope (2011) and use Schmid and
Schmidt’s (2006) formula to estimate an overlap coefficient (OC):

                                        1 +∞
                                        2 ∫−∞
                                   1−         f ( x ) − g( x ) dx,                                (2)
                                                                   

where f(x), in this case, represents the distribution of ideology among
Republicans, and g(x) represents the distribution of ideology among Democrats.
An OC of 1 indicates that the two distributions completely overlap, and are
therefore not polarized, when an OC of 0 indicates complete separation of the
two groups. Again in the appendix (Figure A2), I simulate two sets of distributions—ones that are not polarized (OC = .64) and ones that are (OC = .30).
   The OC coefficients for each year in the ANES data are plotted in figure 1
(solid line). By this metric, the parties have become polarized. In 1972, the

two distributions were heavily overlapping (coefficient = .68), but by 2012, the
degree of overlap had dropped by 45 percent (coefficient = .39).
   However, the liberal–conservative scale may be a poor measure of ideological polarization. As discussed by Hare et al. (2015), a variety of response biases
affect the validity of this scale, such as exaggerating the distance between
oneself and the opposing candidate. Once Hare et al. correct for differential
item functioning (DIF), the distribution of ideological self-placement among


398                                                                                       Lelkes


the mass public is much more bimodal and the degree of overlap between
partisans is smaller than if we use the uncorrected distribution. Additionally,
the ideological self-placement measure may be devoid of ideological content,


                                                                                                      as many self-identified conservatives hold liberal attitudes (Malka and Lelkes
2010; Ellis and Stimson 2012).
   Other scholars have relied on other methods to tap into ideology. For
instance, a number of researchers have extracted latent ideology from
a set of policy items through factor analysis and its extension—item
response theory—from a set of policy attitudes (e.g., Treier and Hillygus
2009; Jacobson 2012; Ura and Ellis 2012). More sophisticated analyses
come from Pierce (2015) and Hill and Tausanovitch (2015), both of whom
use a Bayesian item response theory method to extract latent ideology
from the almost complete set of policy items in the ANES, starting in
the 1950s. I use Hill and Tausanovitch’s (2015) estimates of ideology to
assess bimodality in the mass public and overlap between Republicans
and Democrats.
   I calculate the bimodality coefficient in the mass public using the bimodality coefficient from 1972 to 2012 (top panel, figure 1, dotted line). Unlike the
ideological self-placement data, bimodality has stayed entirely stable in the
mass public, one bump aside in 1998. Latent ideology among the mass public
is not currently polarized, nor has it been polarizing.
   Next, I assess the amount of divergence between partisans using the overlap coefficient (bottom panel, figure 1, dotted line). This trend is very similar
to that of the self-reported ideology measure. Partisans were actually more
similar to one another in 1972 than the self-reported ideology measure shows
(the degree of overlap was .82 using the latent ideology measure and .73 using
the self-reported measure). By 2008, both measures show the same amount of
overlap between the two parties (~.46).
   Substantively, these results show that the mass public has not diverged
ideologically; partisans, on the other hand, have diverged quite a bit.6
Methodologically, these results show that results from sophisticated methods
are not much different from the results obtained from the traditional 7-point
measure, with two minor exceptions—the latent measures show stability in
bimodality and a somewhat larger drop in overlap between partisans (a 43 percent decrease in overlap using the latent measure versus a 36 percent decrease
in overlap using the self-reported measure).
   In sum, evidence in terms of increased ideological polarization among the
mass public is, at best, mixed. The distribution of ideology among the mass
public is unimodal, and the public is not becoming more ideologically consistent. Polarization, in terms of both divergence and consistency, has occurred
among partisans.

6. It should also be noted that partisans have not only moved apart, but have often moved in parallel in response to political and economic changes (Soroka and Wlezien 2010; Ura and Ellis 2012).


Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                       399


Perceived Ideological Polarization
Another form of mass polarization is perceived ideological polarization, or the
degree to which the mass public perceives the parties and their followers to


                                                                                     be polarized (Hetherington 2008; Lachat 2008; Ahler 2014; Van Boven, Judd,
and Sherman 2012; Levendusky and Malhotra 2015; Westfall et al. 2015).
Perceived polarization may have effects on citizen attitudes that are independent from ideological polarization. For instance, Levendusky and Malhotra
(2015) find that increasing perceptions of polarization cause people to moderate their issue positions while increasing interparty animosity.
   To measure perceived polarization, Westfall et al. (2015) use a series of
questions on the ANES that have asked respondents since 1970 to place each
party on 7-point scales (1 = most liberal position; 7 = most conservative position) on a variety of issues. They then subtract the mean Democratic position
from the mean Republican position, and find that the perceived difference has
increased from slightly more than 1 point in 1968 to slightly less than 2 points
in 2008 (roughly 17 percent of the full perceived polarization scale). However,
the results are non-monotonic: perceived differences were equally as large in
the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s as they were in 2008.
   Given the aforementioned issues of using difference-of-means measures to
assess polarization, I use the overlap coefficient to track perceived polarization
in America. First, I assess the overlap in the mass public’s placement of the
Republican and Democratic parties on seven policy issues asked in the ANES,
with lower values indicating that the two parties are farther apart than higher
values. The thick, solid line in the top panel of figure 2, which is a loesssmoothed estimate across the seven issues, indicates that perceived polarization increased by about 10 percent. While the degree of overlap between the
two parties has decreased by double digits on several issues between the first
time and last time they were asked (aid to blacks—16 points; insurance—30
points; guaranteed jobs—23 points; women’s role—16 points), on other
issues, perceived differences have been stable.
   Separating partisans from non-identifiers indicates that the trend is driven
entirely by partisans. In panel 2 of figure 2, I plot the loess-smoothed overlap coefficients in perceived Democratic Party placement and perceived
Republican Party placement by party identification. Independents perceive no
more polarization today than they did thirty years ago. Regressing the overlap
coefficient on year (rescaled so that 0 indicates 1972 and 1 indicates 2012),
and allowing the intercept to vary by issue, indicates that perceived polarization has not budged among Independents (b = .01, se = .04) but has among
Democrats (b = –.12, se = .04) and Republicans (b = –.14, se = .04).
   There are reasons to be skeptical of these types of measures, however. Two
recent studies (Bullock et al. 2015; Prior, Sood, and Khanna 2015) found that
partisan differences in perceptions of objective economic conditions disappear
once respondents are incentivized to give the right answer. One implication


400                                                                      Lelkes




Figure 2. Degree of Overlap in Perceived Ideology.

of this work is that respondents exaggerate party extremity as a way to criticize the other side and engage in partisan cheerleading. Hence, the increase in
perceived polarization among partisans may be an artifact of other forms of
polarization.
   A concept related to perceived polarization is false polarization, which
is the difference between perceived polarization and “actual polarization,”
which Westfall et al. (2015) define as the difference in average issue positions


Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                                     401


between Democrats and Republicans. Using overlap coefficients to calculate
the degree of actual polarization on these seven issues, I subtract the perceived polarization overlap coefficients from the actual polarization overlap


                                                                                                    coefficients.
   While Americans have always overestimated the differences between partisans, false polarization has actually decreased over time (see bottom panel, figure 2). Regressing false polarization on year (rescaled so that 0 indicates 1972
and 1 indicates 2012), and allowing the intercept to vary by issue, indicates
that, across issues, the gap closed by .11 (se = .03). This finding contradicts
the notion that an increased focus on polarization by the media has increased
(false) perceptions of polarization among the general public (Fiorina, Abrams,
and Pope 2005; Ahler 2014; Levendusky and Malhotra 2015). While perceived polarization is on the rise in America, this trend seems to be increasingly grounded in reality.


Affective Polarization
Partisan identification has become an increasingly strong correlate of political attitudes and behavior (Abramowitz and Saunders 1998; Bartels 2000;
Hetherington 2001; Bafumi and Shapiro 2009). This, some believe, is at
the root of growing interparty hostility, or affective polarization (Haidt and
Hetherington 2012; Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Iyengar and Westwood
2015; Mason 2015).
   As one indicator of affective polarization, scholars have used “feeling thermometers,” measures that ask respondents to indicate on a 101-point scale
how warm or cold they feel toward each party, and subtract feelings toward
the out-party from feelings toward the in-party (see the appendix for wording).
These studies show about an eight-point increase in affective polarization over
time—from .64 points in 1978 to .72 in 2012. Furthermore, these changes
have been driven almost entirely by feelings toward the out-party. In 1978, the
average feeling thermometer score toward one’s own party was .74. In 2012,
the average was .75. Meanwhile, the average feeling toward the out-party was
.47 in 1978, and .30 in in 2012.
   However, feeling thermometers are often criticized. First, their underpinnings are unclear. Do respondents say they feel “cool” toward the other side
because they do not like their policies? Or are these feelings based on increasing social distance, as Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) contend? Additionally,
some have pointed out that feeling thermometers suffer from severe differential item functioning: for some, a warm glow envelops all groups; for others,
the world is a much chillier place (Wilcox, Sigelman, and Cook 1989).7


7. Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) correct for this by focusing on difference scores rather than
raw estimates.


402                                                                                    Lelkes


   Luckily, a number of other indicators of affective polarization have been
proposed. To measure social distance, Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) use
a variant of a measure first created by Bogardus (1925), and later used by


                                                                                                   Almond and Verba (1963). Respondents were asked whether they would be
happy or unhappy if their son or daughter married a member of the other party.
In 1960, only about 5 percent of partisans reported displeasure at the prospect
of interparty marriage; by 2010, that number had increased tenfold, to about
50 percent. This measure is only one of the seven items that make up the original Bogardus scale, which also asks about accepting members of the opposite
group as close personal friends, neighbors on the same street, coworkers in the
same occupation, citizens in their country, visitors in their country, or whether
they would exclude them from their country. While the last three might not be
as relevant to measure partisan prejudice, combining the others might make a
more reliable indicator of social distance than the single-item measure.
   Second, Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) assess changes in partisan stereotypes. For instance, they compare perceptions that out-party members are
intelligent and selfish overtime using data from Almond and Verba (1963) and
more recent data. While these trait questions do not appear on the mainstay of
polarization research—the ANES—other similar indicators do. For instance,
the ANES has, since 1980, asked respondents to indicate whether they see the
major party candidates as intelligent or moral.
   These measures may be biased by social desirability concerns, as respondents may be hesitant to call anyone selfish or not intelligent.8 To tackle this concern, Iyengar and Westwood (2015) used a version of the Implicit Association
Test, a measure designed to tap into implicit attitudes. In these types of studies, explicit measures tend to underestimate the extent of negative sentiment
toward a group (Hofmann et al. 2005). The partisan bias shows the opposite. If
we take the implicit measure to be indicative of a true attitude—a controversial
statement (Fazio and Olson 2003)—or at least an attitude that is less biased by
social desirability, explicit attitudes tend to overestimate the extent of partisan
sentiment. Hence, affective polarization, which is clearly on the rise, seems to
be a unique form of prejudice. Social norms seem to pressure individuals to
overstate their feelings of antipathy.


Discussion
This review described various manifestations of polarization, their operationalizations, and some trends over time. It shows that the motivating question—
are Americans polarized—is impossible to answer without first specifying
the form of polarization. I show that partisans have become more polarized
on all fronts—ideologically (both in terms of divergences and alignment),

8. However, critics of self-reports may find comfort in recent behavioral findings that echo the
survey measures (Levendusky et al. 2015).


Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                       403


perceptually, and affectively. While perceived polarization has increased in
the aggregate, this trend is driven entirely by partisans.
    Each of these manifestations has important implications for the practice


                                                                                     and science of politics. For instance, while the lack of bimodality among the
general public indicates that we should be concerned about representation, the
increasing divergence between partisans indicates that elites are not necessarily out of step with their supporters. While the increased consistency between
ideology and identity indicates that Americans are becoming less “innocent
of ideology” (Kinder and Sears 1985) than in years past (Converse 1964),
it also indicates that partisans are clearly divided into different ideological
groups (even if the spatial distance between these groups is not far). The rise
of perceived polarization may stimulate ideologues to vote, as more is at stake
if they perceive the other side to be distant from their own. Increased affective polarization has the potential to increase incivility between citizens and
decrease their support for compromise. Relatedly, Hetherington and Rudolph
(2015) argue that the affectively polarized will not trust government when the
other side is in power, thereby yielding the dysfunction we see today.
    This is not an exhaustive review of mass polarization, as other forms have
also been discussed that are not featured in this review. Some were omitted
because they do not manifest as public opinion. For instance, I do not discuss geographic sorting, or the degree to which Americans are segregating
themselves into ideologically homogeneous communities (Bishop 2009; Tam
Cho, Gimple, and Hui 2013). Others were omitted because longitudinal public
opinion data are not available. For instance, recent work on value polarization
shows that “American society is characterized by extreme levels of value disagreement rather than broad adherence to a set of common fundamental principles” (Jacoby 2014, 762). The measure used to assess the rank-orderings of
values has only recently been introduced. Finally, some were omitted because
it is not clear whether they are independent constructs or, alternatively, caused
by other forms of polarization. For instance, Jacobson (2003) has shown that
partisans’ approval of presidents has increasingly polarized. In this case, polarized elite choices yield polarized mass opinions (Fiorina and Abrams 2012).
    Future research should assess the causes and consequences of each manifestation. More work is needed that manipulates each form of polarization and
gauges their effects on various political outcomes. For instance, Levendusky
and Malhotra (2015) manipulate perceived polarization by exposing respondents to media coverage that exaggerated the extent of polarization in the public. Affective polarization is likely exacerbated by priming partisan identity.
Bryan et al. (2009) manage to make people more or less ideological by priming schemas that underpin liberal and conservative ideologies.
    In sum, polarization is a complex construct that requires nuanced discussion. To properly inform the public, researchers and journalists must more
clearly specify their operationalization of mass polarization.

Sample Characteristics
The American National Election Studies were conducted every two years between
1972 and 2004, and then in 2008 and 2012. Between 1972 and 2004, surveys


                                                                                      were conducted in English. In 2008 and 2012, the surveys were also conducted
in Spanish among some Latino respondents. In each year, the ANES utilized
an equal-probability cross-section sample of the US population. The sampling
frame of these studies includes all citizens who reside in the forty-eight contiguous states who are of voting age on or before Election Day. Washington, DC,
residents were excluded from the sampling frame in 1978 and 1980. According
to the cumulative file documentation, “the most common NES study design has
been a cross-section, equal probability sample. These designs are typically ‘selfweighting’—i.e., the respondents do not need to be weighted to compensate for
unequal probabilities of selection in order to restore the ‘representativeness’ of
the sample. In several years, however, NES departed from this standard design
and ‘oversampled’ certain groups (African Americans in 1964 and 1968, for
example). In other years, the Election Study combined a panel re-interview with
a cross-section design (as in 1974, for example).” The response rate (AAPOR
RR1) and number of completed interviews, respectively, are the following: 1972
(75.0, 2,705), 1974 (70.0, 1,575), 1976 (70.4, 2,248), 1978 (68.9, 2,304), 1980
(71.8, 1,614), 1982(72.3, 1,418), 1984 (72.1, 2,257), 1986 (67.7, 2,176), 1988
(70.5, 2,040), 1990 (70.6, 1,980), 1992 (74.0, 2,485), 1994 (72.1, 1,795), 1996
(59.8, 1,714), 1998 (63.8, 1,281), 2000 (60.5, 1,807), 2002 (55.8, 1,511), 2004
(66.1, 1,212), 2008 (53.9, 1,212), and 2012 (38, 2,054).

Question Wording
Party identification
Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a
Democrat, an Independent, or what? (IF REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT)
Would you call yourself a strong (REP/DEM) or a not very strong (REP/DEM)?
(IF INDEPENDENT, OTHER [1966 AND LATER: OR NO PREFERENCE;
2008: OR DK) Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or
Democratic party? (1. Strong Democrat 2. Weak Democrat 3. Independent–
Democrat 4. Independent–Independent 5. Independent–Republican 6. Weak
Republican 7. Strong Republican)


Ideological identification
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going
to show you (1996 AND LATER: Here is) a seven-point scale on which the


406                                                                      Lelkes


political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal
to extremely conservative. Where would you place the (Yourself/Democratic
Party/Republican Party) on this scale? (1. Extremely liberal 2. Liberal


                                                                                   3. Slightly liberal 4. Moderate, middle of the road 5. Slightly conservative
6. Conservative 7. Extremely conservative)


Insurance
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital costs.
Some (1988, 1994: people) feel there should be a government insurance plan
which would cover all medical and hospital expenses (1988, 1994: for everyone). Others feel that (1988, 1994: all) medical expenses should be paid by
individuals, and through private insurance like Blue Cross (1988, 1994: or
other company paid plans). Where would you place the (Yourself/Democratic
Party/Republican Party) on this scale (1988 ONLY: or haven’t you thought
much about this)? (1. Government insurance plan 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Private insurance plan)


Guaranteed jobs
Some people feel that the government in Washington should see to it that every
person has a job and a good standard of living. (1972–1978: Suppose these
people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Others think the government
should just let each person get ahead on his/her own. (1972–1978: Suppose
these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people
have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4, 5, or 6.) Where would
you place the (Yourself/Democratic Party/Republican Party) on this scale? (1.
Government see to job and good standard of living 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Government
let each person get ahead on his own)


Aid to blacks
1988 FORM A, 1990 AND LATER: Some people feel that the government in
Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks. Others feel that the government should not make any
special effort to help blacks because they should help themselves. 1970–1984,
1988 FORM B: Some people feel that the government in Washington should
make every possible effort to improve the social and economic position of
blacks (1970: Negroes) and other minority groups (1980: even if it means
giving them preferential treatment). Others feel that the government should
not make any special effort to help minorities because they should help themselves (1970: but they should be expected to help themselves). ALL YEARS:
Where would you place the (Yourself/Democratic Party/Republican Party) on


Poll Review—Measuring Mass Polarization                                          407


this scale? (1. Government see to job and good standard of living 2. 3. 4. 5.
6. 7. Government let each person get ahead on his own)


                                                                                         Government services
Some people think the government should provide fewer services, even in areas
such as health and education, in order to reduce spending. (1996 AND LATER:
Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Other people feel
that it is important for the government to provide many more services even if
it means an increase in spending. (1996: Suppose these people are at the other
end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere
in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.) Where would you place the (Yourself/
Democratic Party/Republican Society) on this scale? (1. Government should
provide many fewer services: reduce spending a lot 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Government
should provide many more services: increase spending a lot)


Defense spending
Some people believe that we should spend much less money for defense. (1996,
2004: Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.) Others feel that
defense spending should be greatly increased. (1996, 2004: Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.) Where would you place
the (Yourself/Democratic Party/Republican Party) on this scale? (1. Greatly
decrease defense spending 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Greatly increase defense spending.)


Women’s rights
Recently there has been a lot of talk about women’s rights. Some people feel
that women should have an equal role with men in running business, industry,
and government. (2004: (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at
point 1.)) Others feel that a women’s place is in the home. (2004: (Suppose
these people are at the other end; at point 7.)) And of course, some people
have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.) ALL YEARS
EXC. 2000 VERSION 2: Where would you place yourself on this scale or
haven’t you thought much about this? Where would you place the (Yourself/
Democratic Party/Republican Society) on this scale? (1. Women and men
should have an equal role 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Women’s place is in the home)

3       Data
A brief overview of the U.S. Congress The
American political system is a bicameral legislature composed of the Senate (100 senators, two
from each state) and the House of Representatives
(435 voting members plus 6 non-voting representatives, number depends on the population of each
state). Election is held every two years, in which
one third of the Senators and all members of the
House face reelection. Members are typically affiliated with either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. Congressional election and Presidential election coincide every four years.

          ABSTRACT. This article summarizes the 3-day international workshop Radio Stars and Their Lives in the Galaxy, held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory on 2012 October 3–5. The workshop
          was organized to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of advances in stellar and solar astrophysics
          recently (or soon to be) enabled by the latest generation of state-of-the-art observational facilities operating from
          meter to submillimeter wavelengths. The meeting brought together both observers and theorists to discuss how radio
          wavelength observations are providing new and unique insights into the workings of stars and their role in the
          Galactic ecosystem. Topics covered included radio emission from hot and cool stars (from the pre- to postmain-sequence), the Sun as a radio star, circumstellar chemistry, planetary nebulae, white dwarf binaries and novae,
          supernova progenitors, and radio stars as probes of the Galaxy.

By monitoring the light curve at a wide range of radio frequencies over time, it is thus possible to probe the entire temperature
and density structure of the remnant and derive a mass estimate,
in a manner that can be equated to “peeling an onion”. However,
the simple picture of a homogeneously expanding shell of ionized gas (the so-called Hubble flow model) breaks down for two
novae recently observed with the JVLA.
    In the case of V1723 Aql, recent JVLA light curves by
Sokoloski and collaborators unexpectedly revealed a strong deviation from model predictions, suggesting the presence of a
large quantity of optically thin material outside of the optically
thick fireball (Krauss et al. 2011). Also, in the archetype of recurrent novae, T Pyx, the radio emission associated with a recent outburst was observed to be delayed by more than 50 days
from the initial outburst, indicating a multi-stage ejection in
which the bulk of the mass (>4 × 105 M ⊙ —an order of magnitude higher than theoretical predictions) was delayed beyond

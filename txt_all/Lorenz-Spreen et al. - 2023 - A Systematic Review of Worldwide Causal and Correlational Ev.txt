       Fundamental Principle of Causal Inference
        In experiments with randomized treatment allocation and perfect compliance, the difference between treatment and control groups can be interpreted
        as the causal average treatment effect (ATE), not considering measurement error.
        However, in observational settings or imperfect experiments, the identification of ATE is likely impeded by the existence of confounders and/or colliders.
        Causal inference techniques aim to get as close as possible to the ideal experimental standard using various statistical strategies, such as:


                                  Matching                                                           Instrumental variables                                                               Panel designs

     The goal is to compare units that are similar in                                                                                                            The combination of cross-sectional and timeBy splitting the variation of the treatment                                     series data in panel settings allows the

Reporting Summary
Nature Portfolio wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency
in reporting. For further information on Nature Portfolio policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.


Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
           The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
           A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
           The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided
           Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

           A description of all covariates tested
           A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
           A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient)
           AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

           For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted
           Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

           For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
           For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
           Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
                                                Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

  Study description                Systematic review, no primary human participant data was collected

  Research sample                  Causal and correlational studies examining digital media and political variables

  Sampling strategy                -

  Data collection                  Studies for our review were collected using a systematic search query (provided in the appendix) on Scopus and Web-of-Science. The
                                   researchers were not blinded.

  Timing                           The latest search query run was conducted in September 2021, no gaps in the sample exist as this query includes all studies that
                                   were published before this date.

  Data exclusions                  We did not include conceptual or theoretical studies, small-N experiments or small-N survey, simulation studies and other evidence
                                   synthesizing work (exclusion criteria are described in the materials and methods section). Those exclusion criteria were preregistered.

  Non-participation                No participants were included in our study.

  Randomization                    For a systematic review, no primary data is collected, hence no experimental groups.


Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods
We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material,
system or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response.

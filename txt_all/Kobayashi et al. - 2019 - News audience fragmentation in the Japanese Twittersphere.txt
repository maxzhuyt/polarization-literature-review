Introduction
Selective exposure and consequential audience fragmentation are central issues in the
study of political communication (Bennett & Iyengar, 2008; Tewksbury, 2005; Webster
& Ksiazek, 2012). As the range of choices available in the media environment has
expanded since the advent of the Internet, the information that people consume has diversified to an unprecedented level, and selective exposure based on personal ideology has
loomed large (Adamic & Glance, 2005; Hargittai, Gallo, & Kane, 2008; Lee & Park,
2010). In particular, the social media environment makes it easy to tune in selectively
to news outlets that share the user’s ideological leanings, resulting in ideology-based audience fragmentation (Conover et al., 2011; Gruzd & Roy, 2014; Hahn, Ryu, & Park, 2015;
Messing & Westwood, 2014). Ideology-based audience fragmentation in this study is
defined as ‘reduced overlap of consumed contents that is caused by the ideological

selective exposure of audience’, which has been robustly demonstrated in previous literature (e.g. Coe et al., 2008; Iyengar & Hahn, 2009; Stroud, 2010).
    Although ideological selective exposure has been well documented in both experimental and observational studies (e.g. Barberá, 2015; Garrett, 2009; Stroud, 2011), the existing
literature has notable limitations, such as an inability to reveal the real-world scale of audience fragmentation as well as the large margin of measurement error in self-reported
media exposure. Against this backdrop, recent studies have taken a more computational
approach by using social media data, because this has several advantages over traditional
methodologies, arising from the availability of massive real-world behavioral data that are
less prone to measurement error (e.g. Barberá, 2015; Golbeck & Hansen, 2014). However,
the current literature on ideological audience fragmentation, which employs computational approaches, still has room for improvement.
    First, with few exceptions, most studies using this approach have been conducted in the
US, and the cross-national validity of their results has scarcely been tested. The high level
of ideological polarization in the US may be idiosyncratic from a global perspective, so
cross-cultural investigation is necessary for assessing the generalizability of US-based findings. Second, previous studies relying solely on behavioral data from social media tend to
make strong analytical assumptions. A typical assumption is that Twitter users on average
prefer to follow media and politicians whose ideological positions are similar to their own
(e.g. Barberá, 2015). Another strong and typical assumption is that the ideology of political
elites can be extrapolated to that of ordinary users. However, these assumptions have not
been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny. In fact, selective avoidance of ideologically
incongruent information has been demonstrated to be relatively weak (Garrett, 2009; Knobloch-Westerwick & Johnson, 2014); therefore, following Twitter accounts across ideological boundaries may be more common than assumed. Furthermore, the ideological
constraints on ordinary people are weaker than those on political elites (Converse,
1964), so the validity of extrapolation from elites to ordinary Twitter users may be limited.
    We aim to address these limitations in the current study. First, we focus on Japan to test
the generalizability of US findings in an Asian context. Second, we do not rely solely on
behavioral measures collected through social media but instead combine survey data
and machine learning to estimate the ideology of Twitter users more precisely. Although
we are not the first to use machine learning for this type of estimation (e.g. Pennacchiotti
& Popescu, 2011; Rao, Yarowsky, Shreevats, & Gupta, 2010), to the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to make use of self-reported ideology among Asian Twitter users for supervised machine learning. Results indicate that our classifier, based on the self-reported
ideology of Twitter users produces more valid estimates than naïve extrapolation from
data from elites. With improved estimates of Twitter users’ ideologies, we demonstrate
that the ideological distributions of those who follow major Japanese media accounts
on Twitter largely overlap, suggesting that ideology-based audience fragmentation is
absent.


Computational approaches to ideological audience fragmentation
One of the notable limitations of experimental studies of selective exposure is that they
cannot reveal the actual scale of audience fragmentation in the real world. Moreover,
selective exposure may be overestimated in experimental studies, because many


                                                       ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION        3


experiments force the participants to choose information from either like-minded or
unlike-minded parties without providing the option to pursue irrelevant information
instead (Clay, Barber, & Shook, 2013). In fact, by analyzing behavioral data on news
exposure collected by Nielsen, Prior (2013) demonstrated that selective exposure
occurs only among a small fraction of people with strong partisanship and that most
people simply tune out from partisan cable news. Similarly, previous studies have
demonstrated that a vast proportion of the online audience concentrate on a small
number of portal sites (Gentzkow & Shapiro, 2011; Kobayashi & Inamasu, 2015;
Webster & Ksiazek, 2012; Webster & Lin, 2002), suggesting an absence of large-scale
ideological audience fragmentation.
   However, the diffusion of social media and the availability of API have made it possible
to collect a massive amount of data that reflect the population more accurately. As an illustration, Kwak, Lee, Park, and Moon (2010) collected Twitter data from 41.7 million
accounts, the population of Twitter users in 2009, and succeeded in estimating precisely
that nearly 85% of the messages flowing through Twitter consist of information originating from traditional news media. In this way, a computational approach to social media
data allows us to overcome the inability of traditional approaches to reveal the true
scale of audience behavior in the real world.
   Selective ideological exposure is confirmed by survey studies that have greater external
validity than experimental studies (Garrett, 2009; Stroud, 2008, 2010). However, it is now
widely known that measurement of media exposure based on self-reports suffers from
large margins of error, which bias the assessment of audience fragmentation. For instance,
Prior’s (2013) survey study demonstrated that those who regularly watch conservative Fox
News constitute 22–24% of the US adults, whereas the behavioral data collected by Nielsen
show that only 6.1% of US adults regularly tune in to Fox News, suggesting that the prevalence of selective ideological exposure is overestimated when measurement is based on
survey data. Behavioral social media data, on the other hand, are less prone to measurement error. As behavior in social media such as following and ‘liking’ can be measured
without self-report, the ambiguity surrounding the self-report measurement can be
circumvented.
   In fact, an increasing number of studies employ the computational approach to study
audience fragmentation. Golbeck and Hansen (2014) estimated Twitter users’ ideology
from the Americans for Democratic Action scores of members of the US Congress
whom they followed and analyzed the type of news media accounts, governmental institutions, and think tanks that they followed. They found that liberals tended to follow
liberal news media accounts selectively and conservatives tended to follow conservative
news media accounts selectively, suggesting ideology-based audience fragmentation
among US Twitter users. Barberá (2015) demonstrated audience fragmentation in five
Western democracies by estimating the ideology of political Twitter accounts including
those of politicians, political parties, media outlets, and journalists. More specifically, he
extracted 2000–5000 followers of each political account and estimated their ideological
leanings using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (for a similar approach, see also
Al Zamal, Liu, & Ruths, 2012). Other studies attempted to estimate the ideology of ordinary Twitter users using the information on the accounts that they followed (e.g. Pennacchiotti & Popescu, 2011; Rao et al., 2010).

Limitations of the current literature
Although a computational approach can address at least some of the limitations of traditional methodologies, the current literature on ideological audience fragmentation
employing this approach still has room for improvement.
    First, because most of the previous studies were conducted in the US, it is not clear how
far we can generalize those findings to other political contexts. The US has a stable twoparty system, and both political elites and the public are polarized along the dimensions of
ideology and partisanship (e.g. Abramowitz & Saunders, 2008; Iyengar & Westwood, 2015;
Poole & Rosenthal, 1984). In a stable two-party system, committing to one partisan position greatly increases the probability of opposing the other partisan position. Furthermore, the US has a prototypically liberal media system characterized by weak
regulation and a lack of the principle of political neutrality (Hallin & Mancini, 2004).
These contextual factors make ideological audience fragmentation more likely.
However, the level of partisan polarization greatly varies across countries, and bipolar partisan polarization is less likely to occur in countries with multiparty or unstable party
systems. In summary, the high level of partisan polarization in the US could be exceptional
from a global perspective, so careful cross-cultural investigation is necessary for generalizing the findings from the US. Evidence of audience fragmentation is particularly lacking
in Asia. One of the few exceptions is Hahn et al. (2015), who analyzed data from all Twitter
followers of 34 Korean news media accounts and survey data from 1811 Korean Twitter
users. They demonstrated that fragmentation in Korean politics was determined by two
primary dimensions; namely, ideology and generation.
    Second, although the computational approach can avoid the low reliability of selfreported measurement by utilizing behavioral data, it typically entails strong analytical
assumptions. The most common assumption is that Twitter users selectively follow
media and politicians whose ideological positions are similar to their own (e.g. Barberá,
2015). That is, Twitter users are assumed to follow ideologically congruent accounts selectively while at the same time selectively avoiding ideologically incongruent accounts.
However, it has been repeatedly indicated in both experimental and survey studies that
selective avoidance of ideologically incongruent information is weak (Garrett, 2009; Knobloch-Westerwick & Kleinman, 2012; Knobloch-Westerwick & Johnson, 2014), and more
balanced information seeking is promoted, especially when the source of information is
perceived as useful (Chaffee, Saphir, Graf, Sandvig, & Hahn, 2001; Frey, 1986). Therefore,
cross-cutting exposure may occur in such a way that users follow media or politicians
simply because they are informative or famous.
    Another strong typical assumption is that the ideologies of political elites can be
extrapolated to infer ideology among ordinary users. For example, Golbeck and Hansen
(2014) extrapolated the ideology scores of members of the US Congress to their Twitter
followers to compute the political preferences of Twitter followers of news media accounts.
However, ideological constraints are weaker for ordinary people than for political elites
(Baldassarri & Goldberg, 2014; Converse, 1964; Lewis-Beck, Jacoby, Norpoth, & Weisberg,
2008); therefore, the validity of such extrapolation from elites to ordinary Twitter users
may be limited. Given that the structure of ideology is qualitatively different between political elites and ordinary people, directly measuring the ideological leanings of Twitter
users should provide greater validity than extrapolating those of elites.

   We aim to address these limitations in the current study. First, we focus on Japan to test
the generalizability of US findings to an Asian context. While Japan shares a democratic
political system with the US, its ideological landscape is quite different, making it a good
place to test the generalizability of US-based findings in an Asian context. Because the generalizability of the US-centered empirical findings is guaranteed only when they are replicated across various political institutions and contexts (McDermott, 2011), it is crucial to
investigate ideological audience fragmentation in countries outside the US. Specifically, in
Japan, those who do not support any party make up 60% of the electorate, and media–
party parallelism is remarkably low (Goldman & Mutz, 2011). The less ideologically
polarized context of Japan offers a strict context for testing the hypotheses of ideological
audience fragmentation. Second, we do not rely solely on followership behavioral
measurement but instead combine survey data and machine learning to estimate the ideologies of Twitter users to avoid making strong analytical assumptions. Employing a classifier trained using Twitter users’ self-reported ideologies would produce more valid
estimates than naïve extrapolation from those of the elites.1


Method
The target population of our study is defined as Japanese Twitter users who follow at least
one media account and at least one member of the Japanese Diet. This population does not
represent all Japanese Twitter users, and they are expected to be more politically active
than users who do not follow any Diet members (Barberá, 2015; Kobayashi, 2017).
However, their online behavior may be highly informative about ideological audience fragmentation because they are more likely to be knowledgeable and interested in politics than
the average citizen (Barberá, 2015). If we do not observe audience fragmentation among
this segment of Twitter users, then it would be absent even if we extended the target
population.
   We first conducted an online survey of Twitter users who followed at least one media
account and at least one member of the Japanese Diet. Second, using Twitter users’ surveymeasured ideologies, the list of the Diet members whom they followed, and the texts of
their tweets as training data, we applied supervised machine learning to build a classifier
to estimate their ideologies. Third, we used this classifier to estimate the ideologies of all
Twitter users who followed at least one media account and at least one Diet member (N =
605,446); i.e. the population of this study. Finally, using estimated ideologies of Twitter
users and the list of the media accounts that they followed, we evaluated the scale of ideology-based audience fragmentation at the population level. Each step is described in greater
detail in the following sections.


Online survey
In September and October 2014, we recruited a set of Twitter users from the Rakuten
Research panel who followed the accounts of at least one media outlet and one Diet
member. We initially recruited 3420 Twitter users who claimed that: (1) they have
Twitter accounts; (2) their accounts are public; (3) they follow at least one media outlet
and one Diet member, and (4) they agree to disclose their Twitter accounts to us.
Based on the disclosed Twitter accounts and Twitter API, we found that 2930 of 3420


6       T. KOBAYASHI ET AL.


respondents’ accounts were open to the public. Of these 2930 respondents, 1724 respondents followed at least one media outlet and one Diet member. We approached these 1724
users and received responses from 1493 of them.
   The list of media accounts is presented in Table 1; it includes all the major national
newspapers, the public broadcaster (NHK), key commercial network stations, and
wired news agencies. Although estimating the ideological slant of news media is beyond
the scope of the present study, the ideological leanings of major national news media
have been consistently demonstrated by content analyses (e.g. Ding, 2016; Pak, 2016)
and by Bayesian ideal point estimation using Twitter data (Miwa, 2017). Specifically, it
is well established and widely acknowledged by the public that Asahi, Mainichi, and
Tokyo Shimbun have liberal leanings, whereas Yomiuri, Nikkei, and Sankei Shimbun
have a conservative slant (Akuto, 1996). The ideological leanings of NHK and national
networks are less clear because of the political impartiality principle of the Japanese Broadcast Act.
   Table 1 also shows the number of followers as well as the number who follow at least
one Diet member – the target population of our analysis. For Diet member accounts, we
included those held as of 19 April 2014 by 418 of a total of 722 active Diet members. The
accounts of media and Diet members that each respondent follows were identified using
Twitter API. Furthermore, up to 3200 past tweets were collected for each respondent, the
maximum possible number retrievable using API, for building classifiers.
   The ideology of the respondents was measured using issue attitude items from The
University of Tokyo/Asahi Shimbun Survey (UTAS), which is a publicly available
survey administered to all the candidates and randomly sampled Japanese voters during
national elections since 2003. The merit of using UTAS is that most elected Diet
members have responded to these items. This means that the ideology of Twitter users

and that of the Diet members whom they follow can be independently estimated on the
same scale, without extrapolation from Diet members to ordinary users. Specifically, the
six items with a five-point scale were summed and rescaled so that the measure ranges
from 0 to 1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88; higher value means conservative ideology): ‘The
constitution should be revised’; ‘The defensive strength of Japan should be further
increased’; ‘North Korea needs pressure more than dialogue’; ‘Limitations on privacy
and individual rights are justified to protect the peace’; ‘Non-Japanese permanent residents should have the right to vote in regional elections’; and ‘Moral education should
be expanded.’ All these issues can be mapped onto traditional ideological dimensions in
Japan (Kabashima & Takenaka, 2012).
   Furthermore, based on the information collected through Twitter API, the names of
Diet members whom each respondent followed were presented in the online survey questionnaire, which measured their approval or disapproval. The results indicated that
60.95% of the respondents followed more politicians of whom they approved than
those of whom they disapproved, whereas 16.68% followed more politicians of whom
they disapproved than those of whom they approved. The rest of the respondents
(22.37%) followed equal numbers of politicians of whom they approved and disapproved,
or they only followed politicians of whom they neither approved nor disapproved (the
difference between the number of approved politicians and disapproved politicians is illustrated in Figure OA1 in the Appendix). This result suggests that, on average, Twitter users
prefer to follow politicians of whom they approve, whereas a nonnegligible number of
users decided to follow Diet members even though they disapproved of them. At the
level of each following behavior, the data indicated that 16.59% of decisions to follow
Diet members were made by users who disapproved of them and 38.19% were made by
users who neither approved nor disapproved of the members, so less than half of the
follows were by users who explicitly supported the Diet members.


Supervised machine learning
Next, using respondents’ ideology measured in the online survey, information on the Diet
members whom they follow, and the texts of their tweets as training data, we employed
supervised machine learning with the aim of constructing a classifier that estimated the
ideology of those who follow at least one media account and at least one Diet member
but did not respond to the online survey (hereafter called nonrespondents).
    The training data consisted of respondents’ self-reported ideology as the dependent
variable, and following/nonfollowing of the 418 Diet members and the texts of tweets
as independent variables. While previous studies have shown that the following pattern
is informative for estimating users’ ideology (Barberá, 2015; Golbeck & Hansen, 2014),
Rao et al. (2010) found that texts extracted from users’ tweets are also useful for
machine learning to predict their political leanings. Therefore, to select a classifier that
has the best predictive performance, both types of information are utilized as independent
variables.
    Random Forest was used to construct the classifiers because it is known to attain high
accuracy by integrating and combining multiple learning devices (decision trees) that are
created from a training data set (Breiman, 2001). Random Forest can be used for data
classification as well as for regression by aggregating decision tree outputs (Liaw &


8         T. KOBAYASHI ET AL.


Wiener, 2002). As different weights are estimated for following different Diet members,
employing Random Forest is a significant improvement over the methods of previous
studies that estimated users’ ideology by simply averaging the ideology scores of the politicians whom they follow (e.g. Golbeck & Hansen, 2014). Assigning different weights to
the acts of following different politicians is more realistic because the ideology of users
would be more strongly reflected by following politicians whose ideological positions
are well known through frequent appearances in the media, whereas the association
between the ideologies of users and the politicians whom they follow would be weaker
when they are less recognizable to the public, so their ideological positions remain
unknown to users.
    To evaluate the performance of the estimated regression models, mean squared errors
(MSEs) were calculated to quantify the discrepancy between the observed and predicted
outcomes. Table 2 shows average MSEs based on a 10-fold cross-validation of each classifier. As a benchmark of performance, we also calculated MSE using the method of
Golbeck and Hansen (2014), which estimates users’ ideology by simply averaging ideology
scores of the Diet members whom they follow. The ideology scores of the Diet members
were calculated in the same way as those of respondents by using their self-report
responses to UTAS. Model 1 utilized only the information about the following patterns
of respondents; i.e. which of the Diet members they followed. Models 2 and 3 relied on
the texts of tweets of each respondent rather than his or her following patterns, while
Models 4 and 5 made use of both types of information. N-gram refers to the text
mining method that considers consecutive N words in the texts as an independent variable. We employed 1-gram and 2-gram tweets as independent variables because Rao
et al. (2010) demonstrated that Twitter users’ ideology can be accurately predicted by
N-gram analyses of tweets. We also varied the number of independent variables used
for each classifier, because more predictive variables would cause noise in the estimation
and thus deteriorate the predictive performance. Independent variables for each classifier
were selected based on MSE (Grömping, 2009).
    As a result, all five models proposed were found to perform better than the benchmark,
as smaller MSEs indicate better performance. In particular, Model 5 consistently demonstrated smaller MSEs than the other classifiers. On the other hand, the MSE of Model 5
decreases as the number of independent variables increases from 100 to 500 but stops
decreasing when more than 500 independent variables are included, arguably because
the less important N-grams caused noise in the estimation. Based on these observations,

we employed Model 5 with 500 independent variables to build a classifier to estimate nonrespondents’ ideology.
    In addition, to assess the potential noise created by including disapproving follows, we
calculated MSE using only approving follows and found that it (0.033) was not substantially improved from the original model, suggesting that the detrimental effect of including
disapproving follows is minimal.


Estimating nonrespondents’ ideology
Using the classifier of following patterns, we then estimated the ideology of 603,952 nonrespondents who were identified through Twitter API as of 17 June 2014. Figure 1 presents
the kernel density distribution of the ideology of respondents, nonrespondents, and the
population that consists of respondents and nonrespondents. As the number of nonrespondents is far larger than that of respondents, the distributions of ‘Respondents and
Nonrespondents’ and ‘Nonrespondents’ almost completely overlap.
   The validity of estimates of ideology was tested by checking their correlation with the
ideology of the Diet members followed. Given the previous findings on selective exposure,
there should be a positive correlation between the estimated ideology of Twitter users and
that of the Diet members whom they follow. Note that the ideology of Diet members was
measured in UTAS independent of that of Twitter users. More specifically, the classifier to
estimate Twitter users’ ideology was trained with the respondents’ self-reported ideology
as the dependent variable and the list of the Diet members followed with the texts of their
tweets as the independent variables. Therefore, the ideological scores of the Diet members
were not used for the estimation, rendering it an appropriate external standard by which to
assess the validity of estimation.
   We found a highly significant correlation of 0.68 (p < .01) between Twitter users’ ideology and the average ideology of the Diet members whom they follow, supporting the validity of our estimation. When we break down the users into respondents and

nonrespondents, the correlations were 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. To avoid potential noise
from including disapproving follows, we validated our estimation by calculating the correlation between the users’ ideology estimated only from their approving follows and that
of the Diet members followed. The correlation was 0.71 (p < .01), which is not a remarkable improvement from 0.68, the correlation when the users’ ideology is estimated from all
their follows. This result suggests that the validity is robust regardless of whether disapproving follows are included. Furthermore, we used the estimated ideology of Diet
members reported by Miwa (2017) as another validation standard. Miwa (2017) applied
Barberá’s (2015) Bayesian ideal point estimation to Japanese Twitter data to estimate
Diet members’ ideologies. Therefore, although Miwa (2017) also used Twitter data, his
estimation strategy was completely different from that of the present study. When we
use the Diet member’s ideology reported by Miwa (2017), the correlation between
Twitter users’ ideology and the average ideology of the Diet members whom they
follow was highly significant (r = 0.69, p < .01), further supporting the validity of our
estimation.


News audience fragmentation in the Japanese Twittersphere
Figure 2 shows the distributions of followers’ ideologies per media account for 605,446
users. It illustrates that most of the media accounts have followers whose ideology is centered around the grand mean of the population, which is 0.61, indicating that significant
differences are not observed across media accounts in terms of the distribution of their
followers’ ideologies. The only exceptions are followers of Sankei Shimbun and Tokyo
Shimbun. On average, the followers of Sankei Shimbun are more conservative than
those of other media (mean ideology = 0.72), whereas the followers of Tokyo Shimbun
are more liberal (mean ideology = 0.46).
   To probe the reduction in the overlap of consumed contents due to ideological selective
exposure, we ran a simulation to obtain the baseline following pattern of media accounts
that precludes ideological selective exposure in all decisions to follow (see OA1 in the
Appendix for details of the simulation). The comparison between observed and simulated
following patterns of media accounts revealed that ideologically moderate popular media,
such as NHK, attract more followers than the baseline and that the followers of small but
ideologically distinct media, such as Sankei Shimbun and Tokyo Shimbun, tend to follow
fewer media accounts than the baseline. Combined with the ideological distribution of
each media account (Figure 2), the former result indicates that the majority of Twitter
users in Japan selectively follow ideologically moderate popular media accounts (which
suppresses ideological audience fragmentation), whereas the latter result suggests a
partial fragmentation of those who follow ideologically distinct media accounts.
   Next, to assess audience fragmentation in more detail, we evaluated the overlap among
followers for each pair of media accounts using Jaccard coefficients (An, Cha, Gummadi,
& Crowcroft, 2011).2 In the presence of audience fragmentation, the Jaccard coefficient
becomes smaller because there is less overlap of followers; the Jaccard coefficient
becomes larger when audience fragmentation is absent. Jaccard coefficients are reported
in Table OA1 of the Appendix. Figure 3 is a network representation of the overlap of followers based on the Jaccard coefficients, where each node denotes a media account, the
size of a node is proportional to the number of followers, and the width of an edge is


                                                          ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION   11

proportional to its Jaccard coefficient. Colors indicate followers’ ideological slants, with
red and blue representing media preference by conservative and liberal followers,
respectively.
   Figure 3 illustrates that the major media accounts positioned at the top of the network
are in general connected by thicker edges, suggesting greater overlap of followers among
these accounts. As an illustration, although the ideological leanings of conservative
Yomiuri and liberal Asahi Shimbun are said to be polarized (e.g. Tokuyama, 2014), the
Jaccard coefficient between the two major national newspapers is 0.30, meaning that
30% of the Twitter users who follow at least one of the publications Yomiuri and Asahi
Shimbun follow both accounts. That is, no ideological audience fragmentation among
the major Japanese media accounts was observed.
   In contrast, the media with ideologically distinctive followers tends to have thinner
edges with other accounts, suggesting that the followers of these accounts are more

fragmented than the major accounts at the top of the figure. As an illustration, the largest
Jaccard coefficient of Sankei Shimbun is 0.05, while that of Tokyo Shimbun is 0.10,
suggesting that the ideologically distinctive followers of these two media accounts are isolated from the audience of major media accounts. In summary, ideological audience fragmentation in the Japanese Twittersphere is limited in that it is observed only among a few
media accounts that have small number of ideologically distinctive followers.3


Discussion
By addressing the limitations of existing computational approach of social media analysis,
this study evaluated the extent of ideological audience fragmentation in the Japanese Twittersphere. Specifically, by using survey data and supervised machine learning, we estimated Twitter users’ ideological leanings without extrapolating from those of political
elites. This combination of self-report and behavioral measurement performed better
than a computational approach relying solely on social media data. Using the estimated
ideology of Twitter users, we demonstrated that large-scale audience fragmentation is


                                                      ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION        13


absent from the Japanese Twittersphere, with a few exceptions of small media outlets followed by ideologically distinct users. These findings not only contribute to the development of computational analysis of social media but also suggest that the US findings on
ideological audience fragmentation are not necessarily replicated in Asian contexts.
   The most significant methodological contribution of this study is that it showed that the
combination of survey data and machine learning is capable of predicting Twitter users’
ideology more precisely than previous methods that rely solely on social media data. As
the performance of classifiers heavily depends on the quality of training data, directly
measuring the users’ ideology via online survey has a great advantage over the extant
methodologies. In addition, varying the number of independent variables and the
length of N-grams allowed us to employ a classifier that can stably outperform others.
In fact, our findings suggest that the ideologies of Twitter users can be more accurately
predicted directly from their following patterns and the texts of their tweets than from
simple extrapolation from elites’ ideologies. Most importantly, with these methodological
improvements, Twitter users’ ideologies were estimated with high precision, even in Japan
where the ideological constellation is far more ambiguous than that in the US (Kabashima
& Takenaka, 1996). This is significant progress in light of the remarkably different levels of
political polarization in the two countries.
   All these methodological improvements culminate in the substantial finding that ideological audience fragmentation is not taking place on a large scale in the Japanese Twittersphere. Most media accounts are followed by both liberal and conservative users, and the
followers of major media accounts overlap to a significant extent, which is in remarkable
contrast to the US findings. Selective exposure to social media does not take place independent of the political contexts in the real world. Therefore, we should be cautious in
extrapolating the US findings to other political contexts, as the ideological polarization
in the US has been exacerbated to an unprecedented extent. This is especially important
when we study Asian political communication, because the ideology of Asian countries is
both qualitatively and structurally different from that in the US (e.g. Kabashima & Takenaka, 2012; Lu, Chu, & Shen, 2016). In this sense, this study serves as counterevidence to
the naïve technological determinism that postulates that the use of high-choice social
media triggers ideological selective exposure and leads to audience fragmentation.
   Several limitations remain to be addressed. First, the respondents in the present study
were not randomly sampled from the population (i.e. they were Japanese Twitter users
who follow at least one media account and at least one member of the Japanese Diet),
so we cannot preclude potential systematic sampling bias.4 To maximize the representativeness of the sample, future work should adjust the following pattern of respondents
based on that of nonrespondents, either by weighting or by case selection. Moreover,
although it is methodologically challenging, random sampling of respondents should
also be attempted to obtain a representative sample of Twitter users who satisfy certain
conditions.
   Second, the classifier based on the following pattern regardless of approval or disapproval (Model 1 in Table 2) did not obviously underperform the classifier we selected
(Model 5 in Table 2). Similarly, the classifier based on only approving follows did not
have significantly smaller MSEs or substantially greater validity. These results indicate
that the prediction of ideology was robust, regardless of whether disapproving follows
were included, even though the online survey revealed that fewer than half of the


14         T. KOBAYASHI ET AL.


follows were by those who explicitly supported the Diet members. Future studies are
needed to determine why the performance of machine learning is largely sustained even
when approval or disapproval in following is ignored.
    Third, although the method we proposed to predict Twitter users’ ideology outperformed existing methods, even in Japan where ideological constellation is unclear, the
cost of running an online survey to obtain high-quality training data for machine learning
is significant. In addition, using the texts of tweets as independent variables in machine
learning requires substantial preprocessing. These costs can be regarded as disadvantages
of the proposed method.


Notes
     1. We acknowledge that self-report measures of ideology are not without measurement error.
        However, ideology is known to predict a range of political behaviors and its measurement
        is well established (e.g. Conover & Feldman, 1981; Jost, 2006). Furthermore, the merit of
        measuring the ideology of Twitter users rather than extrapolating it from political elites is
        clear because their ideologies are not as constrained as those of elites (Converse, 1964).
        Therefore, it can be assumed that using self-reported ideology is at least less problematic
        than using self-reported media exposure.
     2. The Jaccard coefficient is defined as Sim(A, B) = (|A∩B|)/(|A∪B|) and is a value between 0
        and 1. If there are no users following two media accounts, the Jaccard coefficient is 0; if
        the followers of two media accounts match exactly, the coefficient is 1. The robustness of
        the results was tested by using other measures of similarity. The correlation between
        Jaccard and Dice coefficients was extremely high (r = .99, p < .01). Simpson coefficients of
        small sets tend to be inflated, even when their associations with other sets are weak, so
        they are not suitable to measure the similarities between media accounts on Twitter that
        vary in terms of the number of followers.
     3. To assess the level of fragmentation at the user level, we extracted audience clusters from a
        user–user network (605,446 × 605,446) using the Louvain method (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008) (see OA2 in the Appendix for the details). The results of clustering
        corroborated the findings shown in Figure 3. That is, although the overall level of fragmentation was low (with most of the news audience following ideologically moderate media
        accounts), the segments of the audience following Sankei Shimbun and Tokyo Shimbun
        were extracted as small but distinct clusters, indicating partial fragmentation.
     4. To check the similarity between respondents and nonrespondents, we compared the distribution of Diet members that these two types of users followed. To account for the multiparty
        nature of the Japanese Diet, we classified members into those who belong to the incumbent
        governing parties and those belong to opposition parties. Thirty-one percent of all respondent follows were of governing party Diet members, compared with 32% for the nonrespondents, indicating that there is no meaningful difference between the following behavior of
        respondents and nonrespondents.
